Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption A wall titled \"Who's The Next To Drop Out?\" with faces of the Democratic candidates running for president in the 2020 election is displayed during the Netroots Nation conference at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia on Saturday. Justin Krebs, a campaign director with MoveOn, isn't interested in hearing pundits debate which 2020 Democratic candidate is the most \"electable.\" \"Because exactly four years ago right now there was a messy, crowded primary, with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable, and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning,\" he pointed out. And in the same vein, many Democrats thought Barack Obama was unelectable until he started winning primaries in 2008. Progressives say this word \"electability\" is being used as a fear tactic to intimidate voters into choosing a moderate, centrist nominee, specifically, former Vice President Joe Biden. But many of the activists who gathered over the weekend at the Netroots Nation conference insisted that's a foolish strategy. Biden, who has consistently led in early polling, is potentially the worst option for the party, they say, warning that Democrats could repeat the mistakes of 2016. Their main criticism of Biden is two-fold: He's too moderate on economic policy and has a complicated record on criminal justice and race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum. Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum. There isn't unanimous agreement among progressive activists about who they want as a nominee. Some remain deeply loyal to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his role in pushing the party leftward. Others say they like the policy plans that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been rolling out. And yet others say they like what California Sen. Kamala Harris represents \u2014 a black woman who could take on President Trump. But where activists agree is on Biden \u2014 they would prefer almost any other 2020 Democrat over him. While they are purists in many ways, if Biden were to become the nominee, activists at Netroots said, they would vote for him, perhaps begrudgingly. Their fear is that others will not. Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration. Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration. \"We need to be able to build a coalition of voters that are excited, that are gonna turn out at historic levels, and we can't rely on it just being based on Trump being on the ballot; that won't be enough,\" said Maria Urbina, national political director for Indivisible. She didn't single Biden out by name, but she said whoever the nominee is, he or she has to energize the Democratic base, specifically young voters and minorities. Activists also point out that Republicans under a Trump administration have not toned down their rhetoric; why, they ask, should Democrats moderate their message? Many say that Hillary Clinton tried that strategy in 2016, and it clearly failed. They still ponder \u2014 maybe, if Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had been the nominee, the Democrats could have won the White House. Allegra Dengler, a Democratic activist from Westchester County, N.Y., one of nearly 4,000 activists who attended Netroots Nation, says people including her own son didn't like Clinton. They were looking for a change-maker.

Her son voted for Trump in the 2016 election, but she says he would have voted for Sanders, if he had been the Democratic nominee. Biden doesn't seem like a change-maker to her, either. \"We need to go to the future,\" she says. \"Why is he so popular? I have no idea. He's like a corporate Democrat from Delaware, which is like the corporate headquarters of everything.\" Activists say the party needs an inspirational candidate, and moderation doesn't inspire people. Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America, spoke on a pop-up panel at Netroots Nation about \"Why Joe Biden is the least electable major Democrat for president in 2020.\" Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America, spoke on a pop-up panel at Netroots Nation about \"Why Joe Biden is the least electable major Democrat for president in 2020.\" \"If you can afford for the world not to change, you take the slow approach,\" said Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America. \"If you're a privileged few that can wait for 'Medicarefor All,' then maybe you can be a moderate, but we don't have time for that.\" Several major presidential candidates have adopted progressive ideas that were previously on the fringe of the Democratic Party, such as Medicare for All. But one candidate who has not is Joe Biden. On Monday, he unveiled a health care plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid and creating a more robust public option. It was a clear contrast to the more progressive alternative. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that,\" Biden said in a video. He warned that overhauling the system would be too risky. The fight over health care is a proxy for the broader ideological battle in the Democratic Party with Sanders on one end and Biden on the other.

Charlie Neibergall/AP hide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a presidential candidates forum sponsored by AARP and The Des Moines Register on Monday in Des Moines, Iowa. Sanders has long championed a Medicare for All system. And he plans to deliver a speech on Wednesday to \"confront the opponents of Medicare for All.\" Sanders' supporters feel that Biden's approach is too incremental and antiquated. The goal, progressives say, is not merely to maintain the ACA, but to establish universal health care. But that's not the goal of most voters, who are more concerned about the cost of health care than the system itself, says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president of social policy and politics at the centrist think tank Third Way. \"It gives a huge window for Donald Trump and Republicans to label Democrats as socialists and have that label stick,\" said Erickson, who's skeptical of how progressives are framing the debate. Democrats, she says, have a clear road map to the White House in 2020 \u2014 they need to follow what they did in the 2018 midterms. \"The margin for taking back the House came from people who switched their votes, not people who stayed home, so if we are going to win again and beat Donald Trump, we absolutely need to win some folks who are coming over from the other side,\" Erickson said.

He continued the back-and-forth ahead of a House vote condemning his tweets. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump again criticized a group of four House Democrats for their comments about his policies. He continued the back-and-forth ahead of a House vote condemning his tweets. Updated at 7:05 p.m. ET The House of Representatives approved a resolution Tuesday evening condemning the president for a series of racist tweets about four Democratic lawmakers. The vote was mostly along party lines, as the House split 240-187, with four Republicans supporting the nonbinding measure. Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Susan Brooks of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas joined with Democrats to rebuke the president, as did Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party to become an independent. The House was paralyzed for a substantial portion of the afternoon over legislative procedure. Republicans sought a ruling on the question: Does calling the president's tweets \"racist\" violate the rules of decorum established in the House? So an already heated debate turned to farce as the House voted on whether to sanction House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for characterizing the president's remarks as \"racist,\" as part of a debate on a resolution that also calls the president's remarks \"racist.\" At issue was the phrasing of Pelosi as she spoke in favor of the resolution. \"Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets,\" she said. \"To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.\" GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, objected to the language, calling it \"unparliamentary,\" and called for her comments to be \"taken down\" \u2014 officially removed from the record. When that happens, the lawmaker is no longer allowed to speak on the House floor for the remainder of the day. House rules prohibit impugning the motives of a person during legislative debate. There is no explicit rule that states that lawmakers cannot call comments \"racist,\" but there is precedent for declaring these sorts of characterizations out of bounds. The rules and precedents are outlined in Jefferson's Manual, which lays out parliamentary procedures. As House staff and lawmakers huddled to sort out what to do and expected a decision, the presiding chair of the House, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., unexpectedly dropped his gavel and declared that he was \"abandoning the chair.\" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer later delivered the ruling that Pelosi's words were not in order, but Democrats defeated a vote to strike them from the official congressional record. Both the attempted sanctioning of the speaker of the House and Cleaver's decision to walk off the floor and leave the House without a presiding officer are highly unusual developments in the House. The resolution states that the House \"strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" The president's weekend comments about four female members of Congress have done what Trump's remarks so often do: take control of the agenda in Washington, D.C. As the weekend began, lawmakers expected that this week would be focused primarily on issues like a proposal to raise the minimum wage, a budget deal and a vote holding the attorney general in contempt over the 2020 census. The president's tweets upended the whole order. His tweets, in which he implored four women of color to \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came,\" dominated the conversation in the capital \u2014 with Democrats condemning it and Republicans being asked to defend or denounce it. The statements targeted four freshman progressive lawmakers: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All but Omar were born in the United States. In response to the president's comments, Ocasio-Cortez responded that telling \"four American Congresswomen of color\" to \" 'go back to your own country' \" reflects the \"hallmark language of white supremacists.\" Ahead of the debate on the House floor, Democrats were warned to watch their language. In a meeting with his Democratic colleagues Tuesday morning, Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., reminded lawmakers about the House rules saying they cannot impugn the personal motives of the president. Pelosi suggested to the caucus that they could use phrasing like his \"words were racist,\" noting that such nuance allows them to make their point and stick within the rules. While some Republicans in the House and Senate have criticized the president's comments, GOP leadership in the House of Representatives stood with the president. Asked if the president's tweets were racist, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that they weren't.

        "title": "John Paul Stevens, Retired Supreme Court Justice, Dies At 99 : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, a veteran of 34 years on the U.S. Supreme Court, has died. He was 99. Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford. And while he was once viewed as moderately conservative, he eventually earned a reputation as the most liberal justice on a court dramatically more conservative than the one he joined in 1975. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: John Paul Stevens, often called a judge's judge, was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, law and politics were a noble pursuit not a blood sport. The quintessential Midwesterner Stevens was born in Chicago, educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and, later, appeals court judge. In 1975, President Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. And Stevens, wearing his trademark bow tie, was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. Given his lack of political ties, Stevens' rise was, to some extent, a fluke, according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan. CLIFFORD SLOAN: It was an accident of history, and the stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment. TOTENBERG: A brand-new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. And with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also picked for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism. Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence. Over time, he was seen as an increasingly respected and influential justice, a man beloved by his colleagues for his decency, his unassuming nature and his tough inner core. In his first decade, he was viewed as a center-right justice. But as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member - a moniker he never liked. Indeed, Stevens said forthrightly in 2010 that it wasn't he who changed. Rather, it was a court populated by new justices with a conservative ideology that Stevens saw as quite radical. Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to obscenity, from school prayer to campaign finance reform, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. TOTENBERG: As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED OLSON: The crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident. TOTENBERG: The decisions Stevens will likely be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-3 decision repudiating President Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004, he authored the court's 6-3 decision, allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones; the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN PAUL STEVENS: In the entire history of the republic, only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. As for the case at hand, there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly after discovery is concluded. TOTENBERG: Critics thought Stevens' view naive - the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And, indeed, as it turned out, Paula Jones' case led directly to the impeachment of President Clinton. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system; that no person is above the law. While Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together, under one legal tent, justices one might not expect to agree, he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens, the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star, objected, declaring that the value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, when the court majority ruled that a key section of the Brady gun-control law unconstitutionally conscripted local law enforcement to conduct background checks on gun buyers, Stevens took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties. Since the ultimate issue is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency - matters such as the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic or, perhaps, the threat of an international terrorist. TOTENBERG: Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later, when he managed to eke out a 5-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program. TOTENBERG: Stevens' angriest dissent came, without doubt, in Bush v. Gore. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner in this year's presidential election, he wrote, the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law. Two other dissents were barn burners as well. His 2008 dissent, when a five-justice majority struck down a local ban on handguns, ruling for the first time that there's a constitutional right for individuals to own a gun - and his 2010 dissent, when the same five-justice majority struck down a century-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections. Stevens' oral dissent in the campaign finance case, provided here by the Oyez Project, was passionate and long. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Simply put, corporations are not human beings. In the context of an election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Corporations cannot vote or run for office. Because they're managed (ph) and controlled by non-residents, their interests may conflict in fundamental ways with the interests of eligible voters. The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporate speakers exactly like human beings in the political realm represents a radical change in the law. TOTENBERG: Behind the scenes, Stevens was often a persuasive and strategic thinker. In 1992, for instance, he played a pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. The court was split into three separate factions - four justices to reverse Roe outright, three to uphold its core but allow more regulation by the states and two, including Stevens and Harry Blackmun, to uphold Roe entirely. Upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it, and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority of 5. The three quickly agreed, and the opinion became the law of the land. In a 2010 NPR interview, Stevens said that in his three and a half decades on the court, he really had just one regret. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEVENS: I think there is one vote that I would change. And that's one - was upholding the Texas capital punishment statute. TOTENBERG: He cast that vote in 1976, at a time when, he noted, the court had adopted many rules to limit the death penalty to a narrow category of offenders and to prevent what he called loading the dice for the prosecution. But over time, those limiting rules were abandoned. And so in his later years, Stevens opposed most death sentences, winning rare but important victories, as when he wrote the court's opinion striking down capital punishment for the, quote, \"mentally retarded.\" He maintained he was undecided about retiring. But in late June of 2010, his lengthy dissent in the campaign finance case was marred by verbal flubs. He was so distressed by his performance that he sought a complete checkup by his doctor. There was nothing wrong. But not long thereafter, Stevens announced his retirement. In the years afterwards, he continued to be both physically and intellectually active, playing tennis and golf, writing articles and books and speaking about the court and its work. When he thought the court in error, he lobbed critiques, as always, pointed, literate and respectful. The very qualities that made him such a revered figure in the law. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. KELLY: And the news again for those of you just joining us - retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens died this evening at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The cause was complications following a stroke. And Nina Totenberg is here with us live. Hey there, Nina. TOTENBERG: Hi there, Mary Louise. KELLY: Hey. My main question for you, as somebody who's covered the court for so many years - tell me your best Justice Stevens story. How will you remember him? TOTENBERG: I will always remember him as such a gentleman, that when he would ask a question - and he asked very good questions - he would say something on the order of, excuse me, counsel. Forgive me. Maybe I'm not quite understanding you, but - and then he would ask this question that would go to the heart of the case.

        "title": "Steve Bullock, Montana Governor And 2020 Candidate, Vows To Tackle 'Dark Money' : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: Montana Governor Steve Bullock started his presidential campaign late, and so he missed the first Democratic primary debate. His campaign says he's qualified for the next round later this month. Now, at the center of his campaign is dark money. In the latest installment of MORNING EDITION's Opening Arguments series, our policy conversations with 2020 candidates, Bullock says he thinks anonymous money from corporations and lobbying groups has corrupted our democratic process. And he started with an example. STEVE BULLOCK: Think about the first George Bush. George H.W. Bush said we will lead on climate change, and we'll lead from the top. That was 30 years ago. And now Republicans can't even acknowledge that climate change is human caused or real because of the outside spending in our elections. If we can't take care of the corrupting influence of money in our elections, everything else that the Democrats are talking about, we're going to run into the same problem. KING: Can I just ask what reforms you would make specifically on dark money? Like, what are your plans? BULLOCK: So Day 1, I'd sign an executive order that says if you want a contract with the federal government I can't tell you, you can't spend or donate, but you have to disclose every single dollar that you are either spending are donating to influence our elections. Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference. My legislature was about two-thirds Republican when we passed a bill that said 90 days out from election, you have to disclose every nickel that you spend. Never forget, when I was running for reelection, Day 90, all of that dark money spending stopped. And if we could kick the Koch brothers or other groups out of Montana, we ought to be able do it everywhere in the country. KING: Let's turn to foreign policy, which is something that, as a governor, you haven't had a tremendous amount of experience with. Would you end U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen? BULLOCK: I would. What's happened in Yemen has been failed from the beginning. So I think that we actually need to actually be withdrawing the U.S. dollars but try to bring the U.N. in together for more of a peacekeeping role. KING: Would you withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan? BULLOCK: I would want to make sure that we are completely out by the end of my first term. KING: 2024? BULLOCK: 2024. KING: You are one of just four Democratic candidates in a very large field not to pledge that you will not take money from the fossil fuel industry. Why not? BULLOCK: Well, I've - and look, the overall efforts in trying to make sure that all money's disclosed has been the fight of my career. And what I've said from the beginning is I'll disclose every single dollar that's donated to my campaign with full transparency. No PAC money. No corporate money. But haven't said this industry or that industry. We just won't accept dollars. KING: But why not? BULLOCK: To be candid, I don't even know if I've gotten one nickel from anybody in the fossil fuel industry. We could certainly check and get back to you. But it's just - if it's an individual giving a donation, I'm not going to put these lines around, here's who's worthy to give and who's worthy not to give. And I also think that there's something about this, too. Like, you know, Montana's a coal state. KING: Yeah. BULLOCK: We have to take immediate and durable action on climate change. But I think at times, Democrats will turn around and say - you know, folks, this example that it powered this country for their whole lives and worked hard - at times, there's a perception that Democrats think something's wrong with those individuals. So I think that we have to be careful, especially the workers, that we're not demonizing what they've chosen to do to actually feed their family. But we're trying to make this transition fast. KING: You said we should rejoin the Paris climate deal. We should note that even if the signatories to that deal meet their goals, which they're not on track to do, global temperatures will still rise over what scientists refer to as the threshold of catastrophe. What else will you do to make sure that doesn't happen? BULLOCK: You bet. And the scientists say we have to be net-zero emissions, carbon neutral, as a world by 2050. I think we could do it by 2040, or even earlier. KING: If you were the president, how? What's your plan? BULLOCK: We need to make federal investments in everything from those opportunities upgrading the grid to investing in agriculture. There's sustainable agriculture, and the Dairy Council's examples, already saying here's how they can be net-zero emissions. We can't do this alone. As you know, China emits twice as much as we do. We know that we have to take about a billion tons of CO2 out a year if we're going to actually meet these targets. And I think bringing together everybody from conservationists, to labor to utilities and say let's actually make this track an opportunity. KING: You are an interesting candidate in a very specific way. You're a politician whose mind has changed on a very real topic, which is gun control. You used to not support a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. But you changed your mind, and now you do. What year did you change your mind? BULLOCK: '17 or '18 is when I said universal background checks. It was just last year on assault weapons. KING: That puts you behind a lot of the country, though. And I wonder why that is? BULLOCK: Yeah. KING: Why'd it take you so long? BULLOCK: So we had a \"March For Our Lives\" in Helena, in Montana. I was asked to speak and supposed to speak. I went with my children, and I listened. And as these kids are saying, enough. That's where I finally said, enough with the assault weapons. Because I know as a gun owner. I know that it's not for hunting. I know it's not for self-defense. There's no reason to continue to sell these. KING: When you talk about dark money, you talk about how Americans are supposed to count equally and that dark money sort of perverts that. There is a norm that you are very clearly seeking to return to in the United States. But I wonder, what do you think American democracy looks like in the wake of the Trump presidency? Are there norms to return to, or has this country changed forever? BULLOCK: There has to be. I mean, I think that we are at a tenuous time in this 243-year experiment called representative democracy. And that's one of the reasons why I got into this because I think that things fundamentally change if this guy is reelected. The norms and expectations, and the behavior that's been normalized, and the lies and the misstatements that divide us by race, by gender, by geography, I think that there are norms to be returned to. And I think that we've got to make sure that people know that they're as important as any corporation on Election Day, and every one of us have the same amount of influence over elections. That's how we make sure that the norms are restored, that people feel like that they have a role and a voice in this representative democracy. KING: Montana Governor Steve Bullock, thanks so much. BULLOCK: Thank you so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

        "texts": "Ryan Lucas Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife, Nydia Stone, left federal court in Washington, Tuesday, July 16, 2019. Sait Serkan Gurbuz/AP hide caption Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife, Nydia Stone, left federal court in Washington, Tuesday, July 16, 2019. A federal judge on Tuesday barred President Trump's longtime informal adviser, Roger Stone, from posting on Instagram or other social media platforms through the end of his trial. Judge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that Stone had violated an earlier gag order with a series of social media posts and media contacts over the past several months. \"Mr. Stone, what am I supposed to do with you?\" Jackson said during a more than two-hour hearing. \"Whether the problem is you can't follow simple orders or won't, I need to help you out.\" The answer, Jackson said, is to expand the previous conditions of release and the gag order that barred Stone from discussing his case or its participants in public or online. Stone has pleaded not guilty to obstruction, false statements and witness tampering, and is scheduled to go on trial in November. The case against him was brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller's office, but is now being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. At Tuesday's hearing, Jackson summarized the history of the restrictions she has placed on Stone and the lawyers in the case. She noted that Stone's attorneys have not raised any First Amendment or other objections to the gag order she imposed in February. The order, she said Tuesday, is \"clear as day.\" Over the course of an hour, Jackson went through a long list of instances in which Stone allegedly violated the court's gag order with posts on social media posts or contacts with the media. Those include a statement to BuzzFeed alleging that some of Michael Cohen's congressional testimony was a lie. They also included a series of posts on Stone's Instagram account, including one related to public filings in his case and another criticizing the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California. The criminal charges against Stone relate to his testimony before that committee, which was investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The defense: It was mostly just reposts Stone's attorney, Bruce Rogow, argued that none of the examples put forward by the government violate the court's order that Stone not discuss the case or its participants publicly. Many of the posts, Rogow said, amount to nothing more than Stone reposting someone else's statement. \"It's not a Roger Stone statement,\" he said. \"He's republishing it.\" Jackson pushed back. \"Isn't that how Instagram and Twitter work?\" she said. \"That's the power of it, the speed of it, the multiplication of it.\" Rogow pivoted to the question of whether the posts could taint the jury pool, which he said was the reason the gag order was imposed in the first place. \"None of these are the kind of things that have any reasonable basis to believe it will infect a fair trial,\" he said, arguing that none of Stone's Instagram posts got much traction online. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis disagreed. \"We believe the most recent posts clearly demonstrate a present risk to a fair trial and demonstrated that he's not able to follow the [gag] order,\" Kravis said. Asked by Jackson what he would recommend she do, Kravis said he thought the judge should at a minimum clarify the previous gag order. He also suggested prohibiting Stone from using social media completely. The government did not, however, recommend that Stone be jailed pending trial. Ultimately, Jackson ruled that Stone's posts had indeed violated her gag order. \"To suggest the posts aren't statements about the case ignores the power of social media,\" Jackson said. \"Maybe his lawyers don't understand it, but he does.\" The obvious purpose behind Stone's use of social media, she said, \"is to gin up more public comment and controversy about the legitimacy of the Mueller investigation, the House investigation, to get people to question the legitimacy of this prosecution.\" In the end, Jackson barred Stone from using Instagram, Facebook and Twitter through the end of his trial. His behavior so far, she said, has \"more to do with middle school than with a court of law.\" His ban from social media includes no forwarding, re-posting, retweeting or liking. All of the previous restrictions barring him from publicly discussing the case still remain in place. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

FaceApp hide caption The viral face-transforming FaceApp climbed to the top of the App Store on Wednesday. The growing popularity of FaceApp \u2014 a photo filter app that delights smartphone users with its ability to transform the features of any face, like tacking on years of wrinkles \u2014 has prompted Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer to call for a federal investigation into the Russia-based company over what he says are potential national security and privacy risks to millions of Americans. \"It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of U.S. citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,\" Schumer said in a letter to the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission. \"I ask that the FTC consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the privacy of Americans using this application, including government personnel and military service members, from being compromised,\" the senator wrote. BIG: Share if you used #FaceApp:The @FBI & @FTC must look into the national security & privacy risks nowBecause millions of Americans have used itIt\u2019s owned by a Russia-based companyAnd users are required to provide full, irrevocable access to their personal photos & data pic.twitter.com/cejLLwBQcr Even as privacy advocates raised security concerns, FaceApp's mug-morphing powers lured celebrities \u2014 or anyone who had their picture saved to their phone \u2014 such as Drake and the Jonas Brothers, to try on graying hair and wrinkles. By Wednesday, FaceApp had topped Apple's and Google's app download charts. Schumer's appeal echoed concerns expressed earlier in the day from the Democratic National Committee, over fears that its artificial intelligence technology could expose vulnerable facial recognition data to a country that launched a hacking campaign against the party during the 2016 election. The DNC has since expanded its cybersecurity efforts, including bringing on chief security officer Bob Lord. In an email sent to 2020 presidential campaign staff Wednesday, Lord urged \"people in the Democratic ecosystem\" against using an app that could have access to its users' photos. \"It's not clear at this point what the privacy risks are, but what is clear is that the benefits of avoiding the app outweigh the risks,\" Lord said in a notice first reported by CNN. \"If you or any of your staff have already used the app, we recommend that they delete the app immediately.\" Prior to the Democratic warnings, FaceApp began responding to a flood of inquiries about whether the company stores user data and where. FaceApp told TechCrunch in a statement that while its research and development team is based in Russia, no user data are transferred there. The company that created FaceApp, known as \"Wireless Labs,\" also claims that \"most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.\" Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told the website that FaceApp, headquartered in St. Petersburg, uses Amazon's cloud platform and Google Cloud to host the app data, where it processes \"most\" photos. Uploaded photos, FaceApp said, may be stored temporarily for \"performance and traffic\" to ensure users don't repeatedly upload the same photo as the platform completes an edit. Users have expressed concerns that the app has access to their entire respective iOS or Android photo library even if the user sets photo permissions to \"never.\" But FaceApp told TechCrunch that it only processes photos selected by the user \u2014 slurped from their photo library or those captured within the app. Security researchers have done their own work to back that claim. Will Strafach, a security researcher, said he couldn't find evidence that the app uploads the camera roll to remote servers. FaceApp also said that 99% of users don't log in and, for that group of users, it doesn't have access to any identifying data. Many data privacy experts are wary about these kinds of machine-learning apps, especially in a post-Cambridge Analytica era. Last year, Facebook said up to 87 million of its users' personal information was compromised by the third-party data analytics firm after an apparent breach of Facebook's policy. FaceApp's terms of service state that it won't \"rent or sell your information to third-parties outside FaceApp (or the group of companies of which FaceApp is a part) without your consent.\" But it's that parenthetical clause \u2014 giving leeway to an open-ended, unidentified \"group of companies\" \u2014 that raises a red flag for Liz O'Sullivan, a technologist at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, and, she said, leaves the door open to another Cambridge Analytica-type scandal. \"My impression of it honestly was shock that so many people were, in this climate, so willing to upload their picture to a seemingly unknown server without really understanding what that data would go to feed,\" she said. \"For all we know, there could be a military application, there could be a police application,\" O'Sullivan said of FaceApp. In the event FaceApp sells its platform to another company, its privacy policy states, \"user content and any other information collected through the service\" are also up for grabs. This app is one of many that leave open the potential to advance facial recognition software that, often unknown to users, is created from a compilation of people's faces. In many cases, O'Sullivan said, the public doesn't find out what information is being collected about them until we see personal data revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests. This month, as NPR has reported, researchers received records through one such request to find that Immigration and Customs Enforcement mines a massive database of driver's license photos in facial recognition efforts that may be used to target undocumented immigrants. Researchers have concluded facial recognition technology is biased and imperfect, putting innocent people at risk. O'Sullivan wants to see more regulation in place that's designed to protect consumers. Like her, many security advocates in the U.S. will be watching Europe's testing ground as lawsuits against tech giants play out under the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the European Union's sweeping new data privacy law.

Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images hide caption Eugene Scalia (left) talks with Missouri Sen. Kit Bond before Scalia's confirmation hearing to be solicitor of the Labor Department in 2001. Updated 8:30 p.m. ET President Trump will nominate Eugene Scalia, son of late Justice Antonin Scalia, to be the next labor secretary, the president announced via Twitter Thursday evening. I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor. Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience.... A source close to Scalia earlier Thursday confirmed to NPR that the president had offered Scalia the job and that he accepted. Scalia, 55, is a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, D.C., where he handles cases related to labor and employment. In the early 1990s, Scalia served as a special assistant to Attorney General William Barr during Barr's first stint leading the Justice Department. Scalia also served as the solicitor of the U.S. Labor Department, the agency's top lawyer, during the George W. Bush administration. Current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned effective Friday. Acosta has been caught up in controversy surrounding his handling of a plea deal involving financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein pleaded guilty to felony charges of soliciting minors for prostitution. He also had to register as a sex offender. Epstein is facing new charges in New York of sex trafficking. In 2005, Wal-Mart hired Scalia to defend it against lawsuits from former employees who said they were fired for calling out wrongdoing within the company.

Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar at a press conference at the Capitol on Monday. President Trump has accused the \"squad\" of hating America and has said they should \"go back\" to where they came from. President Trump is showing no signs of dialing back what Democrats are calling a \"blatantly racist attack\" on four members of Congress, who are all women of color. Trump is accusing the \"squad\" of \"radical Democrats\" of hating America and has said they should \"go back\" to where they came from. Three of the four congresswomen \u2014 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 were born in the U.S. The fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, became a U.S. citizen at age 12. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the use of the racist trope \"disgusting\" and vowed a resolution condemning the president's language, while Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, said Trump's xenophobic attack was new grounds for impeachment. Pressley, who is African American, blasted the president for \"the callous, chaotic and corrupt culture of this administration.\" The president seems more buoyed by the criticism than bothered, insisting that \"a lot of people love\" his Twitter attack on the progressive Democrats. But in the Massachusetts district where Pressley was elected, constituents are far more livid than loving it. Even those who support the job Trump's doing as president are rolling their eyes at his antics as they decide to look past them. \"He's racist, he's psychotic and he's destroying democracy,\" proclaimed D.L. Polonsky, who was wearing a \"Deport Trump\" button last night in Allston, a gritty neighborhood of Boston that Pressley represents. Polonsky, an anti-Trump political cartoonist, says he's deeply offended by the president's latest comments, but not surprised. He sees it as a deliberate political stunt meant to rally Trump's base. \"He's just trying to distract,\" he says. \"He's just gaslighting and he's just a disruptor.\" \"It was flat out racist. I don't think there's anything grey about it, and I'm horrified that he represents our country,\" echoes Deanna Byrne, a Democratic political activist who has worked for Pressley's campaign. As she sees it, Trump has hit a new low \u2014 yet again. \"It's dangerous because he's normalizing this,\" she says. \"And if the bar keeps moving in that direction, what's the situation going to be two more years from now?\" Sarah Leib, a bartender at Silhouette Lounge in Allston, Mass., believes Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, but he's jacking up resentment among white Americans. Tovia Smith/NPR hide caption Sarah Leib, a bartender at Silhouette Lounge in Allston, Mass., believes Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, but he's jacking up resentment among white Americans. Around the corner at a neighborhood dive called the Silhouette Lounge, bartender Sarah Leib says the damage is already apparent. Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, she says, but he's also jacking up resentment among white Americans. She points to a recent incident when she refused to serve a man drinks because he was already drunk. \"He accused me of not serving him because he's a white male,\" she recalls. \"He made himself out to be the victim of a big conspiracy. I've never seen anything like that.\" Leib says Trump's comments were not only offensive, but also absurd. Members of Congress, she says, don't deserve to be attacked simply because they're being critical of policies. \"That's what they're supposed to do,\" she says. \"I mean, they're doing their job, and they're doing it effectively. But [Trump's] ego is so fragile that he says some asinine thing that [becomes] news.\" Ana Maria Arabanos, 23, who was sipping a drink at the bar, also takes offense at Trump's antics but sees a silver lining: The whole uproar is focusing positive attention on the \"squad\" \u2014 including her congresswoman, Pressley, she says. \"I'm grateful we do have leaders that are representative of me, like being a woman of color, who are standing up to Trump,\" she says. \"It's putting them in the spotlight.\" Another patron, 60-year-old Republican Chris Kennedy, who voted for Trump, sees a different upside. While he doesn't like the president's comments, he says he's happy that Trump is drawing attention to issues he cares about, like immigration policy. \"I think that as negative as he is, and as much as a troublemaker as he is,\" Kennedy says, \"[Trump] is contributing to a very positive forward momentum because politicians behind him will have no choice but to focus on these issues that he has pushed to the surface.\" Bill Rhodes, 54, in town on business from Connecticut, is also a Trump fan. But, he explains, that's only because he \"purposely\" doesn't even look at Trump's tweets. \"You can't let it bother you because, I mean, he says stupid stuff every week,\" he says. \"But as long as he's doing a good job, then that's good. I mean, my stock has soared, and you know, the economy's doing well.\" That is far more important, Rhodes says, than Trump's comments, which he considers more questionable than overtly racist. \"Unless [Trump] actually called them out on race, I don't think it's racist,\" he says. \"I mean, I've heard others say stuff like that too.\" Alan Walter, 65, says he's among those likely to make a comment like Trump's, and he loves that the president is proving he doesn't cow to political correctness. Walter points his disappointment instead at Democrats who he says are unfairly playing the race card. \"The racist thing is so burnt out, man,\" he sighs. \"It's such a sad, sad thing. It's such a lame label to throw [around], to just say, 'Oh he's a racist.' It's the easiest thing to do.\" But Walter also agrees with Trump critics on one thing: that the president's controversial comments are less a slip of the tongue than a deliberate strategy aimed at winning him a second term in office.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan testifies on security at the border and migrant detention during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Thursday. Updated at 6:12 p.m. ET Homeland Security acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan says the U.S. has apprehended more than 800,000 migrants attempting to enter the country since last October, calling the numbers staggering and unprecedented, and that the influx has \"challenged and overwhelmed every aspect of our border and immigration enforcement system.\" Still, McAleenan said DHS \"made significant strides in its effort to secure the border and help and protect migrants in our custody.\" McAleenan testified on Capitol Hill Thursday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, as Democrats step up oversight of an immigration crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border. He told the panel that fewer than 1,000 children have been separated from their families out of some 450,000 family units that have attempted to cross the border in the current fiscal year. McAleenan said a recently passed package of humanitarian aid has allowed CBP to construct four temporary tent-like shelters to house those placed in detention at the border, alleviating the overcrowding at some CBP facilities. That same money, he testified, resulted the a reduction in the \"in-custody population of children from a high of 2,700 to about 350 at the end of the day yesterday.\" He credited Trump administration policies for leading to a 28% reduction in border crossings last month. Democrats pushed back against what oversight committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., called McAleenan's attempts to \"sugarcoat\" conditions for detained migrants. When McAleenan insisted his agency was doing its \"level best,\" Cummings shot back: \"What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on, man. What is that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\" Watch the exchange below or at this YouTube link. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., held up pictures of men and children at DHS faculties she said she visited, saying, \"This would not be allowed as a kennel for dogs.\" But McAleenan said Congress specifically excluded funding for more beds at facilities run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, exacerbating the overcrowded conditions there. Cummings said, \"When I see the pictures and I hear the testimony. ... I am at a point where I begin to wonder whether there is an empathy deficit.\" But McAleenan insisted, \"We are taking care of these children.\" The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released a report on July 2 warning of \"dangerous overcrowding\" at CBP facilities. \"We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,\" investigators wrote. On another issue, McAleenan said an investigation is underway into a private Facebook group of CBP agents, some of whom reportedly posted racist and anti-immigrant statements. He said the CBP Office of Professional Responsibility has placed several individuals on administrative duties, issued cease and desist letters and is \"moving very quickly to hold people accountable for conduct that doesn't meet our standards.\" Asked by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was reportedly the subject of an obscene manipulated image on the site, whether the agents in involved were still on duty, McAleenan could not say. But he denied there was a dehumanizing culture at CBP. Even as acting homeland security secretary, McAleenan is still formally commissioner for Customs and Border Protection (Mark Morgan is serving as the acting commissioner). McAleenan began serving as the CBP commissioner in March 2018 before being elevated as the acting head of homeland security in April. The former homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, resigned from the post April 7 following a turbulent tenure at the post, and McAleenan was named as her replacement that day. Battle over border crisis Thursday's hearing comes amid a fight between Republicans and Democrats over which policies best deal with the humanitarian crisis at the border. The hearing also comes after dueling White House and congressional visits to evaluate conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border. On July 12, a group of freshman House Democratic members delivered emotional testimony before the House oversight committee on those concerns. The lawmakers recently traveled with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus at the beginning of the month to the border to examine the conditions. \"We do have a crisis at our border, it is one of morality,\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said. \"As we have seen this current strategy unfold, intentional and cruelly created by the Trump administration, dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America, in our America.\" As the lawmakers testified on July 12, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., led a Republican congressional delegation to a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The visit delivered dramatic images of more than 300 detained men, some wearing disposable face masks, standing in cramped quarters behind chain-link fences. \"For [Second Lady] Karen [Pence] and me, it was frankly heart breaking, as parents, to talk to young children who told us of having walked two to three months up the Peninsula to cross into our country,\" Pence said after the visit to a detention facility. \"That has to change.\" VP saw 384 men sleeping inside fences, on concrete w/no pillows or mats. They said they hadn\u2019t showered in weeks, wanted toothbrushes, food. Stench was overwhelming. CBP said they were fed regularly, could brush daily & recently got access to shower (many hadn\u2019t for 10-20 days.) pic.twitter.com/tHFZYxJF7C On Friday, a bipartisan group of House members, led by Reps. Lloyd Smucker, R-Penn., and Dean Phillips, D-Minn., plan to visit points of entry, a Border Patrol station and a processing center. The group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said they hope the fact-finding mission will lead to new solutions. \"The crisis at the border is one of the most pressing issues facing our nation and must be addressed by Congress,\" Smucker said in a statement. \"I am hopeful that the Problem Solvers Caucus can once again work together to put forth bipartisan solutions to this critical issue.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, then 91, works in his office at the Supreme Court on Sept. 28, 2011. Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, whose Supreme Court opinions transformed many areas of American law during his 34 year tenure, died at the age of 99 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., of complications following a stroke he suffered Monday. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed Stevens' death in a statement from the Supreme Court. \"A son of the Midwest heartland and a veteran of World War II, Justice Stevens devoted his long life to public service, including 35 years on the Supreme Court,\" Roberts said in the statement. \"He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Elizabeth and Susan, and to his extended family.\" The court's statement noted that \"he passed away peacefully with his daughters by his side.\" Often called a judge's judge, Stevens was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, law and politics were a noble pursuit, not a blood sport. The quintessential Midwesterner, Stevens was born in Chicago and educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and later appeals court judge. In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike, and Stevens, wearing his trademark bow tie, was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. 'Accident of history' Given his lack of political ties, Stevens' rise was, to some extent, a fluke according to his onetime law clerk, Clifford Sloan. \"It was an accident of history,\" Sloan said, adding, \"The stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment, and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment.\" A brand new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill, and with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also chosen for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism. John Paul Stevens, then 55, talks to reporters in Chicago on Nov. 28, 1975, after being nominated by President Gerald Ford to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fred Jewell/AP hide caption Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work, and for independence. Over time he was seen as an increasingly respected and influential justice, a man beloved by his colleagues for his decency, his unassuming nature, and his tough inner core. In his first decade, he was viewed as a center-right justice, but as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member, a moniker he never liked. Indeed, Stevens said forthrightly in a 2010 interview with NPR that it wasn't he who changed. Rather, it was a court populated by new justices with a conservative ideology that he saw as quite radical. 'Crafty and genial hand' Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to obscenity, from school prayer to campaign-finance reform, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it: \"The crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident.\" The decisions Stevens will likely be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-to-3 decision repudiating president George W. Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004 he authored the court's 6-to-3 decision allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. He also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones, the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Bill Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. \"In the entire history of the republic,\" he said, \"only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. As for the case at hand ... there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly.\" Critics thought Stevens' view na\u00efve \u2014 the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And, indeed, as it turned out, the Paula Jones case led directly to Clinton's impeachment. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system \u2014 that no person is above the law. A dissenting voice While Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together under one legal tent justices one might not expect to agree, he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice during his long tenure on the bench. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens \u2014 the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star \u2014 objected, declaring that \"the value of the of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured.\" When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, when the court majority ruled that a key section of the Brady gun-control law unconstitutionally conscripted local law enforcement to conduct background checks of gun buyers, Stevens took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench. \"The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties,\" he said. \"Since the ultimate question is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency, matters such as ... the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or perhaps the threat of an international terrorist.\" Justice John Paul Stevens, a Chicago native, throws out the first pitch before the Chicago Cubs game Sept. 14, 2005, at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Jeff Roberson/AP hide caption Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later when he managed to eke out a 5-to-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. \"Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program,\" he said. Bush v. Gore Stevens' angriest dissent came, without doubt, in 2000, in the case of Bush v. Gore, which effectively ended the presidential race in favor of George W. Bush. \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election,\" he wrote, \"the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law.\" Two other dissents were barn burners, too. His 2008 dissent, when a five-justice majority struck down a local ban on handguns, ruling for the first time that there is a constitutional right for individuals to own a gun. And his 2010 dissent, when the same five-justice majority struck down a century-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections. Stevens dissent from the bench in that case \u2013 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission \u2014 was passionate and long, lasting more than 20 minutes. \"Simply put,\" he said, \"corporations are not human beings. In the context of an election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Corporations cannot vote or run for office because they are managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interest may conflict in fundamental ways with the interest of voters. ... The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporate speakers exactly the like human beings in the political realm represents ... a radical change in the law.\" Behind the scenes, Stevens was often a persuasive and strategic thinker. In 1992, for instance, he played a pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its landmark 1973 abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. The court was split into three separate factions. Four justices to reverse Roe outright. Three to uphold its core but allow more regulation by the states. And two, including Stevens and Harry Blackmun, to uphold Roe entirely. Upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun \u2013 the author of Roe \u2014 could join most of it. That way, he noted, there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority of five. The three quickly agreed, and the opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey became the new law of the land. Just one regret In his 2010 NPR interview, Stevens said that in his 3 1/2 decades on the court, he really had just one regret: his 1976 vote to revive the death penalty by upholding a Texas death penalty statute. Stevens said that at the time the court had adopted many rules to limit the death penalty to a narrow category of offenders and to prevent what he called \"loading the dice\" for the prosecution. But over time, those limiting rules were abandoned. And so, in his later years, Stevens opposed most death sentences, winning rare but important victories, as when he wrote the court's opinion striking down capital punishment for the mentally retarded. He maintained he was undecided about retiring, but in late June of 2010 his lengthy oral dissent in the campaign finance case was marred by verbal flubs. He was so distressed by his performance that he sought a complete checkup by his doctor. There was nothing wrong, but not long thereafter, Stevens, then 90, announced his retirement. In the years afterward, he continued to be both physically and intellectually active, playing tennis and golf, and writing and speaking about the court and its work. When he thought the court in error, he lobbed critiques \u2014 as always, pointed, literate, and respectful. The very qualities that made him such a revered figure in the law. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption From left, Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand faced off in the June 27 debate. All will be back for next week's rounds. The 20-person lineup for the two-night Democratic presidential debate on July 30 and 31 will look familiar, with just one change from last month's event. Last week, California Rep. Eric Swalwell became the first major candidate to end his White House bid. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2014 after only narrowly missing the mark last time \u2014 will take his place. The criteria for the second debate was the same as the first, requiring hopefuls to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate must have registered at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both requirements \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Loading... The remaining six candidates made the cut because of their standing in the polls, but did not meet the donor threshold \u2014 Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel qualified based on donations alone, but under the DNC formula, polling is given greater weight, thus he didn't make the cut. Ten candidates will be debating each night. Other major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just entered the race late last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who reversed his initial decision to pass on the race last week, also haven't qualified, with little time to register in polls or raise money. CNN, which is hosting this next series of debates in Detroit, will hold a live drawing on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET to determine which candidates will appear on which night. That's where the real shake-up will happen, shuffling which White House hopefuls get to face off against one another and which will have a chance to take aim at the top-tier candidates. In the first debate, Harris seized her chance against Biden in the second night of the debate. She went after him over his past opposition to mandated busing to integrate schools in the 1970s, and Biden faltered in his response. That helped her rise in many polls. On the first debate night, Castro found a chance to emerge from the pack after taking a firm stance on decriminalizing illegal border crossings and taking on fellow Texan O'Rourke's reluctance to back such a change. Castro saw his fundraising surge while O'Rourke has continued to struggle. The stakes of performing well in the July debate could be high for several candidates. The criteria for the third debate in September is expected to winnow the field further. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Democrat Calls For Investigation Into Viral Russian-Developed FaceApp : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST: If you've seen photos of friends or celebrities posting selfies with silver hair and wrinkles lately, it's not the relentless news cycle. They probably used FaceApp. The app can make your face look older, younger, even style your hair. It can be fun, but lawmakers warn users to take precaution. The Democratic National Committee warned presidential campaigns against using it, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on the FBI to investigate. He posted this on social media about FaceApp. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: It allows, quote, \"perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license to your photos, name or likeness.\" So this is a breathtaking and possibly dangerous level of access. SIMON: Louise Matsakis is a staff writer at Wired magazine and joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us. LOUISE MATSAKIS: Thanks for having me. SIMON: In your judgment, is FaceApp really more compromising than Facebook or Instagram, who have billions of users already? MATSAKIS: Absolutely not. I think that one thing to consider here is that this is a much smaller company, and Facebook has argued in the past that they're better at protecting your data because they, you know, inherently have more resources. But I don't think that this FaceApp is necessarily more controversial or troubling because it happens to be made by developers who are Russian. I think that's where kind of the anxiety from lawmakers comes from here. FaceApp, like a lot of these free apps, their business model's around advertising. You know, they're sending some of your data to the Google ad networks. That's what they want here. That doesn't mean it's not troubling for other reasons, but I think lawmakers here are maybe fixating on the wrong issue. SIMON: Why is it troubling for other reasons? MATSAKIS: I think we should be really careful about who we want to share our faces with. This information is really sensitive. It's not something, like Schumer pointed out, that they're going to get back to you. You know, they maintain the rights to these images, and they can do what they want with them. But the reality is we're sharing our facial recognition data with so many companies. And a lot of time, we don't have a lot of control over that. So it's really not just this app, even though it's, you know, called FaceApp, so it seems really literal. But when you upload pictures to dating sites, to Facebook, to, you know, photo-sharing sites like Flickr or Instagram, you're probably in a facial recognition database and you don't know it already. SIMON: I got to tell you. I've been taking pictures of our 16-year-old since she came into our lives. Is it already too late for her? MATSAKIS: Probably. And it's too late for what Georgetown University estimates is probably over half of Americans who are already in a facial recognition database as it stands. You know, that includes when you get a license, right? You know, that license database might be used by the government to create a facial recognition algorithm that includes maybe a dating profile that might be used to identify your gender or something. You know, researchers from Stanford in 2017 actually took photos from a dating network, and they used it to build a very controversial tool that claimed to identify people's sexuality just based on their photo. So, you know, the people who are on that dating site had no idea something like that was going to happen. SIMON: Do companies ever lose control of the data? I mean, that happens with credit card information all the time, doesn't it? MATSAKIS: Sure. And it's not even just losing control. A lot of time, these databases are widely available or they're made public to academic researchers and to corporations in order to foster more scholarship. So a lot of these photos are just out there even if there isn't a data breach to begin with. These big training sets are already available to a, you know, wide array of different actors who want to use them to build tools that they can use to do whatever they want. SIMON: Is there any way to stop this, any way to take steps, even if it's too late to protect your images? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think making sure that your profiles are not public is a good way of doing that. That's really hard because dating profiles, for instance, are inherently public, right? You want other people to see them. But I think really thinking about, do I need to upload this picture right now, is this worth the risk that it poses by uploading it, do I really need to post a lot of pictures of me maybe publicly on Twitter or something like that, or would I rather just have kind of a private Facebook group where I share pictures of my daughter? SIMON: Even if FaceApp isn't as dangerous as some political figures caution, is it good that this conversation - if you please - has been set off? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think this is really great that this conversation is centering on your face, which is such a valuable piece of data for these companies that are building these algorithms, often for troubling purposes, like law enforcement or that sort of thing, or identifying people and perhaps identifying you. And I think that's really an important part of this conversation, even though maybe this app is a little silly. SIMON: When you say it's troubling that law enforcement could use it, I mean, if you're looking for someone who committed a violent crime against someone you love, you're glad to have that technology. On the other hand, if you're a dissident in Hong Kong, you're not glad to have that technology. MATSAKIS: Exactly. I think these conversations always involve a trade-off between privacy and security. And we kind of haven't really figured out that balance with facial recognition data yet. And I think another concern is that a lot of these algorithms have been proven to be inaccurate. You know, people have been arrested for crimes... SIMON: Yeah. MATSAKIS: ...They didn't commit because the algorithm, you know, mistakenly identified them. So I think that's another piece that's really important here. SIMON: Louise Matsakis of Wired, thanks so much for being with us. MATSAKIS: Thanks again. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

Jonathan Wiggs/Boston Globe via Getty Images hide caption A now-closed Irish pub in Lawrence, Mass., displayed an old \"Help Wanted/No Irish Need Apply\" \u2014 a common sight across the country in the mid-1800s. With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life. He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics \u2014 the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants. Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all \"go back\" where they came from. That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves of newcomers have been targeted by individuals, groups and even whole political parties. At times, the motivations have been economic, focusing on competition for jobs and such social goods as housing or welfare programs. But there has also been a recurrent theme of cultural differences \u2013 an emphasis on characteristics of religion or language that identify new arrivals as \"the other.\" Anti-immigration sentiments emerged in force starting in the 1830s, when U.S. citizens descended primarily from English and Scottish settlers bridled at the influx of Irish. Most of the arriving Irish were Catholic, prompting a hostile reaction among some Protestants that led to deadly riots in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The persistence of such prejudice made \"No Irish Need Apply\" one of the most iconic signs in the national memory. After the Irish, the hostile reaction extended to a surge of new arrivals in the 1840s from Germany, again largely Catholic. In ethnic terms, the Irish and Germans were akin to other colonial Americans (and to immigrants arriving from Scandinavia). But they were viewed as different, clannish and hard to assimilate. They were seen as not just competing for jobs but as threatening the social, cultural and political order. They were pilloried as susceptible to criminality and drunkenness and seen as loyal to the foreign power of the pope in Rome.

Read the full captions on the Library of Congress website. In the 1840s and 1850s, political parties formed in the U.S. to oppose the permissive immigration policies of the time. Some of these parties embraced the term \"Native American,\" spawning the label \"nativist\" that has stuck to succeeding generations of immigration opponents. Perhaps the best known of these was the American Party, which began as a semi-secret society (\"The Order of the Star Spangled Banner\"), with members being told to deny any knowledge of it. When they claimed to \"know nothing\" of the group, they were pilloried as the \"Know Nothing\" party \u2013 a name that would long survive the entity itself. The party railed against the new arrivals as an economic, social and cultural threat that was bringing crime, disease, social unrest and the prospect of political takeover at the local level. A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\" The Ohio State University, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum hide caption A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\" The Know Nothings had attracted scores of members of the U.S. Congress at the height of their influence in the mid-1850s, stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of the Whigs. In 1856, they nominated Millard Fillmore, a former president and former Whig, as their national candidate. Fillmore got 21% of the popular vote but only a handful of Electoral College votes, as many of the Know Nothings crossed over to vote for John Fremont, the first nominee of the fledgling Republican Party. The 1860s brought the Civil War and a desperate need for soldiers, leading to greater acceptance of new arrivals who were willing to join the Union Army. In the years that followed, some immigrants found acceptance as veterans, others made their way west to farm the interior or work in its burgeoning cities. The Know Nothings were not an organized force again after the Civil War, but resistance to immigration never left the national conversation. The importation of Asians to work on the Western railroads and harvests introduced another enduring chapter of American nativism. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on nation of origin. Some of the jobs denied to Chinese workers were soon filled by Mexicans. Toward the end of the 1800s, the flow of immigrants from Europe swelled again and changed in its origin. The new arrivals now hailed from Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as from countries that had been sending opportunity seekers across the Atlantic for generations. The proportion of U.S. residents who were foreign-born hit 13.5% in the census report of 1911, the highest it had ever been and a level not reached again until the present decade. When the World War I ended, anti-immigration sentiment reached a new level of intensity as it swept much of the country, helping to fuel a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan among other extremist groups. An old association of immigration and urbanization was renewed when the census of 1920 showed immigrants had helped shift the center of U.S. population from rural areas to cities and big towns. Congress, dominated by members from rural, traditional parts of the country, simply refused to reapportion its seats and redraw election districts to reflect the new numbers. That refusal lasted through four biennial election cycles, during which time Congress also passed an emergency ceiling on annual immigration levels and then lowered that by half again in the Immigration Act of 1924. That law set quotas by country of origin and explicitly preferred Northern Europeans over all others. The official attitude in the 1920s and 1930s included an ambivalence toward refugees from conflicts around the world. In 1939, a German ship called the St. Louis tried to make port in Florida with more than 900 passengers, most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany. U.S. officials in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt refused to let them land. They tried to persuade Cuba to take them, but without success. The ship returned to Europe, where many of the passengers were later arrested. Researchers believe that more than 250 perished in the Holocaust. A generation later, in 1965, Congress passed a more liberal immigration law that eliminated quotas based on nation of origin. The law sought to reunite families and level the playing field for prospective immigrants around the world \u2013 and its impact went far beyond what its sponsors might have imagined. The proportion of foreign-born in the U.S. population rose again from just 5% in 1965 to 14% over the next half century. And these new waves of arrivals would be far more diverse than their predecessors were. They came not only from different parts of Europe but from Asia, Africa and South America as well. By the 1970s, the political focal point was the effect the law was having on the Southwest and the influx of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking populations. Pressure for changing the law grew as latter-day nativists again saw the new arrivals as a social, cultural and political challenge. Many of the same arguments made against previous generations of newcomers were lodged again against Hispanics, including that they would cling to their national culture and language and refuse to assimilate. Labor groups also sought to control the competition from workers willing to take lower wages. But there were powerful business interests, particularly from the agricultural sector, determined to preserve access to migrant workers. In 1986, the Simpson-Mazzoli Act sought to control future immigration, but also granted amnesty to millions of the undocumented people who were already residents. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. It was a compromise meant to appease all sides, but it satisfied few. President George W. Bush, who had long enjoyed high levels of Hispanic support as a candidate in Texas, threw his support behind a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in the mid-2000s. He was joined by Republican rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona and by the Democratic leadership. But conservatives more generally opposed the bill as another extension of amnesty, despite all the sponsors' denials. Since then, the Republican Party has moved far from the Reagan-Bush-McCain attitudes on immigration and embraced the nativist tradition that has also been an element in the mix of its history back to 1856. Declaring his presidential candidacy in June of 2015, Trump issued his much-quoted summary of immigrants: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. [sic] They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. \"It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all South and Latin America, and it's coming, probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence and we don't know what's happening.\" By repeating that these immigrants are \"not ... you,\" the president defined these immigrants as \"the other\" in stark terms. In the past two days, we have seen the president return to that blunt language in describing four women who were elected to Congress in November 2018, largely on the passion of their opposition to the nativism that he, and much of his party, have embraced. The battle lines could not be clearer. And it is a battle that is nearly as old as America itself. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Shankar Vedantam uses science and storytelling to reveal the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior, shape our choices and direct our relationships. Our voices convey so much more than just information. They can tell other people something essential about who we are. Angela Hsieh hide caption July 15, 2019 \u2022 At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear us. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. Plus, we hear how advances in technology might help people with vocal impairments, and consider the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. Psychologist Phil Tetlock thinks the parable of the fox and the hedgehog represents two different cognitive styles. \"The hedgehogs are more the big idea people, more decisive,\" while the foxes are more accepting of nuance, more open to using different approaches with different problems. Renee Klahr hide caption July 8, 2019 \u2022 The Greek poet Archilochus wrote that \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" This week, we'll use the metaphor of the fox and the hedgehog as a way to understand the differences between tacticians and big-picture thinkers. We'll explore the story of a pioneering surgeon whose hedgehog tendencies led him to great triumphs, and a heartbreaking tragedy. This episode first aired in May 2017. July 1, 2019 \u2022 All of us are surrounded by brands. Designer brands. Bargain-shopper brands. Brands for seemingly every demographic slice among us. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself how brands influence you? This week, we look at how companies create a worldview around the products they sell, and then get us to make those products a part of who we are. June 24, 2019 \u2022 More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 \u2014 many of them from heroin and other opioids. One of the most widely-used tools to confront this crisis is a drug called naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose within seconds, and has been hailed by first responders and public health researchers. But in 2018, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior \u2014 and causing more deaths than it saves. This week, we talk with researchers, drug users, and families about the mental calculus of opioid use, and why there's still so much we're struggling to understand about addiction. This episode originally aired in October 2018. Hal Herzog, a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University, says the more we attribute humanlike qualities to animals, the more ethically problematic it may be to keep them as pets. Angela Hsieh/NPR hide caption June 17, 2019 \u2022 Does living with animals really make us healthier? Why do we eat some animals and keep others as pets? This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with psychology professor Hal Herzog about the contradictions embedded in our relationships with animals. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves \u2014 whether that is someone else with the same name or the same birthday. Renee Klahr/NPR hide caption June 10, 2019 \u2022 Are women named Virginia more likely to move to Virginia? Are people with the last name of Carpenter more likely to be carpenters? This week on Hidden Brain, we bring you a favorite 2017 episode about our preference for things that remind us of ourselves, and why this tendency can have larger implications than we might at first imagine. A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services. Angela Hsieh hide caption June 3, 2019 \u2022 Generations of Americans have struggled against segregation. Most of us believe in the ideal of a colorblind society. But what happens when that ideal come up against research that finds colorblindness sometimes leads to worse outcomes? May 27, 2019 \u2022 Many of us intuitively feel that the bitter partisanship of American politics is bad for our nation. So should we be concerned about the health of our democracy? This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit two of our favorite conversations about U.S. politics. We start by talking with political scientist John Hibbing about the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. Then, we explore the role of conflict in democracy with historian David Moss. May 20, 2019 \u2022 It happens to all of us: someone recognizes you on the street, calls you by name, and says hello. You, meanwhile, have no idea who that person is. Researchers say this struggle to read other faces is common. This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit a favorite 2016 episode about \"super-recognizers\" and the rest of us. New research suggests that early investments in children's education can have benefits that last for more than one generation. Angela Hsieh hide caption May 13, 2019 \u2022 Smarts matter. But other factors may play an even bigger role in whether someone succeeds. This week, we speak with Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman about the skills that predict how you'll fare in life. We'll also look at programs that build these skills in the neediest of children \u2013 and new research that suggests the benefits of investing in kids and families can last for generations.

        "texts": "Tamara Keith Franco Ordo\u00f1ez President Trump described the immigration plan presented at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday as \"the best of everything.\" Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption President Trump described the immigration plan presented at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday as \"the best of everything.\" Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET The White House announced Tuesday that it has quietly drafted a 620-page immigration bill and has lined up 10 Republican senators to co-sponsor the measure should it be introduced, according to a senior administration official involved in the process. This builds on a blueprint that President Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner announced in May and that addressed border security and legal immigration but didn't deal with the millions of people currently in the country illegally, including young people known as Dreamers. \"In Washington, I find a lot of people are very quick to say what they are against,\" Kushner said during a Cabinet meeting at which he shared details of the plan. \"But it's very important for us to articulate as an administration what we're for, but to do it in detail. And we're not afraid to put out details because we think that this proposal is a very very good proposal that really is great for America.\" The push for a new immigration bill comes just days after Trump ignited a furious controversy by tweeting that four non-white members of Congress should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four members are American citizens, and three of the four were born in the United States. When the immigration blueprint was first announced, it was greeted with mixed reviews and a heavy dose of skepticism about its political prospects. After that initial burst of energy, Congress seemed to ignore it and the White House stopped talking about it. But Kushner said it remained a top priority. \"The Trump administration, despite what some people say, believes in safe, legal immigration and is against illegal and random migration,\" he said. During the Cabinet meeting, Trump threw his support behind the Kushner-led plan. He called it \"compassionate\" and \"the best of everything.\" \"Our country really has a tremendous immigration gap,\" Trump said, calling the current system a \"maze of complexity.\" This bill, which hasn't been introduced and may not be, was drafted in consultation with about 25 Republican Senate offices and a handful of House Republicans, the official said. The senior administration official said the process included adding items, taking others out and tightening language. \"Now we are at a place where we feel like the bill is substantially complete,\" the official said. It's not clear how having legislative language will get this proposal any closer to becoming law, but the senior administration official said officials had planned to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday. That meeting has been postponed. McConnell has said that any major immigration effort needs to be bipartisan, but Democrats are unlikely to agree to sweeping border security measures without some kind of protections for the so-called Dreamers, brought to the country illegally as children, or the larger 11 million people in the country illegally. Distrust between the White House and Democrats is at perhaps its highest point. This distrust comes as the administration is being criticized for its handling of detained migrant children, its touting of planned immigration sweeps and its defense of the president's racist comments about several progressive lawmakers. But getting Democratic support is not necessarily the president's objective. White House officials recognize the challenges gaining support from Democrats, but a senior administration official said part of the goal is unifying key factions of the GOP about a path forward. Supporters say it also should give Republicans something to rally around for the 2020 elections. And Trump said as much in the Cabinet meeting, saying that \"if it doesn't get passed, it's a campaign issue.\" The senior administration official touted support its received from conservative groups and pundits, including Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham. He bragged that they were able to work with twenty-five Senate offices and a dozen House offices without any any leaks. \"While this plan doesn't make every needed change or fulfill every campaign promise, it offers the country a viable path forward in the face of Democrat immigration extremism,\" said RJ Hauman, the government relations director at FAIR, which advocates for stronger immigration enforcement. The plan includes an updated legal immigration system that replaces allowing entry to low-skilled workers with a merit-based system that prioritizes immigrants with special skills. It would also strengthen border security, increase interior enforcement and tighten asylum procedures. The proposal would also include installing a nationwide federal employment verification program, known as E-Verify, federal program to check whether new employees were legally allowed to work. Conservative groups have long pushed for the program, but big business has lobbied against it. But that may be changing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbied Congress against a national E-Verify mandate during the Bush and Obama administrations, has since welcomed the idea as long as it includes an improved guest worker proposal. The National Association of Manufacturers also supports mandatory employment verification system like E-Verify. When asked about the political realities of a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, a fast-approaching August recess, budget fights and an election year on the horizon, the official returned to what has been a common posture for the Trump White House. \"People in Washington think very conventionally all the time, and immigration is something that has been troubling people for 25 years. Everyone can say what they're against, but nobody can say what they're for,\" the official said. The goal for this document, the official argued, was \"seeing if we can unify the Republicans around this proposal.\" The official readily admitted that the White House could put this out and nothing will happen at all. And \"this will be something that we talk about during the election, but at least the president will be on record saying, 'This is what I am for' in a very detailed capacity.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Democrats are dealing with their largest primary pool in at least 40 years, and how they fare in raking in cash could separate the candidates in the pack. Here are the financial figures that the candidates, including President Trump, have reported to the Federal Election Commission, so far. These numbers reflect the total amount raised through the second quarter of 2019. This includes, among other sources, money raised from individual contributions and money transferred from other campaign accounts, such as a candidate's past Senate or House campaign: Loading... There are also more detailed fundraising metrics that give the public an idea about the priorities of the candidates and how they run their campaigns. Democrats have widely rejected, for example, support from corporate political action committees. While these committees have allowed businesses and trade groups in the past to funnel huge amounts of cash to eager candidates, Democrats have become increasingly worried about the appearance of businesses having undue influence over the political process. Campaigns are also making a point of touting the amount they have raised from small donors (those who give less than $200). These donors, who don't have to disclose their names or information, can represent the measure of a candidate's grassroots support. That, of course, doesn't always translate to primary delegates \u2014 as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders learned during his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2016 \u2014 but it certainly gives candidates staying power. Loading... Candidates are required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission through 2019 and then will switch to monthly reports if they've raised or spent at least $100,000.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption Attorney General William Barr speaks as he stands with President Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during an event about the census in the Rose Garden at the White House earlier this month. The House of Representatives escalated its confrontation with the executive branch Wednesday by holding two Trump administration officials in criminal contempt for not providing complete copies of subpoenaed documents related to the 2020 census. The resolution named Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for failing to cooperate with a congressional oversight investigation. In a deeply divided House, Wednesday's criminal contempt measure passed on a mostly party-line vote of 230-198. The House's lone independent, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, backed the measure. Four Democrats broke with their leaders and opposed it. The rebuke of Trump Cabinet officials comes just a day after the House passed another resolution condemning the president himself for racist tweets over the weekend. The move marks the second time a sitting attorney general has been found in criminal contempt by the House. The first time was back in 2012, when the House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over his failure to turn over documents for the chamber's \"Fast and Furious\" probe. Seventeen Democrats joined with what was then a Republican majority to secure that outcome. In a sign of how long these actions can take, the House and Justice Department engaged in a legal battle that took seven years to resolve \u2014 and without any criminal penalty for Holder. Shortly before the vote, Barr and Ross sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her to postpone the House action and arguing their departments had made efforts to cooperate with the committee. They also said some of the materials requested were withheld because of the president's decision to assert executive privilege. \"By this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own integrity,\" they wrote. Wednesday's vote was a largely symbolic gesture; it's unlikely that the Department of Justice would move to prosecute the attorney general. The House had previously threatened to pursue a vote on civil contempt against Barr but backed off after the Justice Department made some concessions. But the symbolism represents a substantial escalation: These would be the first criminal contempt citations passed since Democrats took control of the House in January. The secretary dismissed the vote as \"just more political theater\" and noted that his department had handed thousands of pages of documents over to the committee already. \"We are not stonewalling. But we are also not yielding on the very, very important matter of executive privilege ... we are not going to be frightened into changing that position just because of some action the House might take,\" Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, told Fox Business on Wednesday morning. House Democrats had demanded information about why the administration sought to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and were not satisfied with the response, saying that neither Barr nor Ross responded to a legitimate congressional subpoena. The Trump administration had earlier told Democrats that it was asserting executive privilege over the requested documents about addition of a citizenship question. Democrats on the House oversight committee say they need these documents as part of their probe into the origins of the citizenship question among Trump administration officials. Democrats have been feuding with the Trump administration over the citizenship question since it was announced last year that the federal government was seeking to add it to the 2020 census. In recent days, following a Supreme Court decision that stalled the administration's efforts, President Trump announced that he's no longer pushing for the question to be included in the census. Shortly after, administration officials were formally accused of improperly covering up the question's origins. Commerce and Justice department officials \"obscured evidence suggesting that the true purpose of Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census \u2014 suppressing the political power of minority immigrant communities,\" alleged lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups challenging the question in court.

        "texts": "Scott Detrow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks about his \"Medicare for All\" proposal on Wednesday at George Washington University. Patrick Semansky/AP hide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks about his \"Medicare for All\" proposal on Wednesday at George Washington University. Hoping to regain momentum as two rival candidates creep closer in the polls, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders returned to his signature policy theme in a major speech Wednesday: a single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" health insurance system. \"The time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman, and child in this country,\" Sanders told supporters and reporters in Washington, D.C. Sanders outlined in broad strokes how he'd implement Medicare for All: He'd lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55 in the first year of the new program, then to 45, then 35, then eventually to every adult. Children, Sanders said, would be eligible for the insurance program in the first year of the transition. Sanders also said he also wants to expand Medicare beyond its current benefits to include dental coverage as well. \"The desire to have teeth in your mouth is a health care issue,\" he said. Sanders argues that universal, government-run health care would lower medical costs and eliminate insurance premiums, deductibles, and payments \u2014 but he also acknowledged his proposal would require tax increases. Sanders mocked the idea of families celebrating the status-quo insurance costs that he has pledged to eliminate. \"Oh my God, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day,\" he said. \"Oh wow, let's celebrate.\" The costs for a program like the one Sanders has outlined long have been a sticking point. Two years ago, California legislative analysts put the price tag of a potential single-payer health care system at $400 billion for California alone. The bill in question died in California's Assembly, which is overwhelmingly Democratic. Striving to stand out The speech comes at a time when Sanders is facing increasing pressure from other Democrats in the top tier of polling and fundraising: most notably, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris. While Sanders had long registered far above any other candidate but former Vice President Joe Biden, Harris and Warren have gained substantial ground in recent weeks. Warren has narrowly jumped past Sanders into second place, behind Biden, in a handful of surveys, and raised more money than Sanders from individual contributions in the last quarter. Sanders' campaign leaders say they're aware of the shifting dynamics but they're not panicking. \"I think it's more of the case that other people are gaining some attention and traction. They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them,\" said campaign manager Faiz Shakir. \"They're fresher to the scene for that reason, so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine.\" Still, Sanders has been reluctant to criticize Warren, Harris and other candidates who have embraced large planks from his progressive platform, even as he competes with them for support. \"Elizabeth [Warren] is a longtime friend of mine, she is a very good senator,\" Sanders recently told NPR. \"Elizabeth's running her campaign. I'm running my campaign.\" The hesitance is especially notable since Harris has repeatedly vacillated on her support for a core aspect of the Sanders Medicare for All plan she has co-sponsored in the Senate: the complete elimination of private health insurance, outside of supplementary plans. In a CNN interview this week, Harris said it would likely take more than four years to fully transition from the current health care system to Medicare for All. Harris also argued that preserving private health insurance ensures more coverage for more Americans without raising taxes on the middle class. Sanders has acknowledged his health care proposals would require higher taxes \u2014 but argues it would also lower medical bills and eliminated insurance costs, making the increase worth it. And while Warren laid out several detailed policy plans during the initial months of her presidential campaign, she too did not unequivocally back the full elimination of private health insurance until last month's debate. Instead of pointing out those inconsistencies to progressives who may be migrating to support for Harris and Warren, Sanders has focused his fire on Biden, attacking what Sanders rejects as a \"middle ground\" approach to politics. Biden's less radical outlook In the days since Biden unveiled a health care plan centered around the existing Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and creating a public option government insurance plan, Sanders and his campaign have gone as far as comparing Biden's view on health care to President Trump's. Earlier this week, Sanders' camp sent an email to reporters warning that an Obamacare-centered health insurance plan \"leaves nearly 10 million people uninsured,\" and \"leaves people at the whims of their employers.\" That's despite the fact that Sanders helped lead the effort to save the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and 2018, when Republican majorities in the House and Senate tried and failed to repeal Obamacare. \"The Affordable Care Act took us a step forward,\" Sanders told NPR in 2017, even as he advocated for an eventual shift to a single-payer system. \"It provided health insurance for over 20 million more Americans. That's no small thing. It did away with the obscenity of preexisting conditions and a number of other essential health care benefits that are now guaranteed to the American people. So it made some real change.\" For his part, Biden has framed Medicare for All as a \"risky\" elimination of an Affordable Care Act that he argues is already here and working. \"I knew Republicans would do everything in their power to repeal Obamacare. They still are. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it,\" Biden said in a campaign video posted this week. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All,\" Biden said. \"But folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

AP hide caption Court documents released Thursday includes details about Donald Trump directing then-lawyer Michael Cohen to help arrange payments to Stormy Daniels and another woman. Updated at 3:14 p.m. ET Donald Trump took part in phone calls with his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen as the attorney and other aides scrambled to arrange hush payments to a woman in 2016 to buy her silence about an alleged sexual relationship with Trump. Those details come from hundreds of pages of court papers \u2014 warrant applications, affidavits and other related materials \u2014 made public on Thursday. Federal Judge William Pauley of the Southern District of New York ordered the documents unsealed after prosecutors said they had concluded their investigation into the scheme and any related campaign finance violations. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges related to payments made shortly before Election Day in 2016 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said that he made the payments in coordination with and at the direction of Trump. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence after he admitted to that and other crimes in court. Cohen remains the only person to be charged in connection with the payments, although two individuals struck nonprosecution agreements with the government in exchange for their testimony. Inside the room While many details about the payments already have been public, the court records released Thursday provide a behind-the-scenes look into how Cohen worked with executives from American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, to make them happen \u2014 and prevent news of Trump's alleged extramarital affairs from getting out ahead of Election Day. Team Trump was particularly desperate to keep a lid on the alleged affairs after news broke of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump uses crude language about touching women. One section of a warrant application filed in April 2018 states that Cohen exchanged a series of calls, text messages and emails with Trump, Clifford's lawyer, Keith Davidson, AMI's David Pecker and Dylan Howard, as well as Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks in the days after the Access Hollywood tape appeared. \"Based on the timing of these calls, and the content of the text messages and emails, I believe that at least some of the communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public, particularly in the wake of the Access Hollywood story,\" the FBI agent wrote in an affidavit supporting the warrant. The agent then details a flurry of calls on Oct. 8, 2016 \u2014 one day after the Access Hollywood tape was revealed in The Washington Post. At around 7:20 p.m., the agent's affidavit says, Cohen received a call from Hicks. \"Sixteen seconds into the call, Trump joined the call, and the call continued for over four minutes,\" it says. The documents then describe a string of calls over the next hour that Cohen made to Hicks, Pecker, Howard and, again, Trump. \"At 8:03 p.m., about three minutes after ending his call with Pecker, Cohen called Trump, and they spoke for nearly eight minutes,\" the papers say. After two more quick calls with Howard, Cohen received a text message from Howard that read: \"Keith will do it. Let's reconvene tomorrow,\" referring to Clifford's lawyer, Davidson. In the days and weeks that followed, the agreement almost unraveled after Cohen failed to transfer the money. He was then left scrambling to finalize the deal in late October. On the morning of Oct. 26, Cohen spoke with Trump twice over the phone. That same morning, Cohen set up a bank account for a shell company he had established earlier that month, Essential Consultants LLC, and transferred funds into the account from a home equity line of credit that he had open at the same bank. The following day, Cohen transferred $130,000 to Clifford, care of Davidson, to buy her silence about her alleged extramarital affair with Trump. Trump then repaid Cohen via a series of checks drawn from accounts he controlled or that were controlled by his business; Cohen revealed copies of some of the checks to Congress in March. AMI, meanwhile, also has admitted arranging a separate payment to McDougal in a so-called \"catch-and-kill\" arrangement to keep her quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump. End to the investigation? Another document unsealed on Thursday was a July 15, 2019, letter to Judge Pauley from prosecutors. They write that they have \"effectively concluded\" their investigations into whether anyone besides Cohen may also be criminally liable for the campaign finance violations, as well as whether certain individuals lied to investigators. After news broke Wednesday that the probe had ended, Trump's personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement that \"we have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation.\" On Thursday, Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, responded with a statement of his own. \"I challenge Jay Sekulow, who issued a misleading and false statement to answer the following two questions: Is it not a fact that SDNY prosecutors found President Trump to have 'directly and coordinated' the commission of a felony involving campaign finance federal laws? Is it not also a fact that upon his loss of purported immunity as president of the United States, he is subject to arrest, incarceration and a trial?\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a late entry to the 2020 race, hopes his red-state credentials will help him connect with voters. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock entered the Democratic primary in May, months after many of his competitors. He has an excuse. \"I had a job to do,\" Bullock told NPR, explaining that the Montana Legislature, which only meets for up to 90 days every other year, was in session until the end of April. \"If I had to choose between saving health care for 400,000 folks or chasing 100,000 donors? Easiest decision I'd ever make.\" But now he's in. The two-term governor and chair of the National Governors Association touts his credentials as the only candidate to win in 2016 in a state that President Trump also won. He has raised about $2 million and may qualify for the upcoming July debates after missing June's. Central to Bullock's campaign is the promise to do away with \"dark money\" \u2014 political money that can't be traced to its source. Before he was elected governor, Bullock served as Montana's attorney general and challenged the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Bullock told NPR's Noel King that on Day 1 he would sign an executive order mandating campaign spending disclosures from federal contractors. \"Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference,\" he said. On why he chose to center his campaign on dark money You could walk down the street, and people don't care necessarily about the money in the system, but they do care that Washington, D.C., doesn't work for them. I mean, we pay more for prescription drugs than any country in the world. We have nothing to show for it ... Whoever cleans this studio tonight will pay more [in taxes] than 60 of the Fortune 500 companies. So if the system is rigged because of the influence of money, that's when folks turn around and say, \"This economy is not working for me, the political system is not working for me\" \u2014 so let's just blow up the system. I've never in 10 years of public office had somebody come up to me and say, \"Oh! There's not enough spending in our elections.\" On his plan to limit dark money contributions Day 1, I'd sign an executive order that says if you want to contract with the federal government \u2014 I can't tell you that you can't spend or donate, but you have to disclose every single dollar that you are either spending or donating to influence our elections. Think about it. The federal government contracts with dang near every company in the country. Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference. On breaking gridlock and reaching rural voters Look, I'm not naive about the challenge, but certainly I tried to build relationships with Republican legislators in my statehouse. But I don't rely on those relationships alone. I go out all across our state. When we got Medicaid expansion through, I probably did 20 community meetings in rural Republican areas that were at risk of losing their hospital. So I think that the next president has to make their case, not just in Washington D.C., but to America. So I'd spend as much time in Kentucky as I am here because if you actually get voters saying, \"We expect more of our elected officials,\" that's how I think things get moved. On reversing his position on assault weapons We had a March for our Lives in Helena, in Montana. ... I went with my children. And I listened. And as these kids are saying enough, too, that's where I finally said enough with the assault weapons, because I know as a gun owner \u2014 and 40% of households in America have firearms in them \u2014 I know it's not for hunting. I know it's not for self-defense. Even industry is stopping this. When I was growing up the National Rifle Association was gun safety and hunting organization. Now it's nothing more than to try to divide people. Taylor Haney and Eric McDaniel produced and edited this story for broadcast.

New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via Getty Images hide caption Tupac Shakur, photographed in New York on Nov. 29, 1994. Keep ya head up, Jerry Foxhoven. The public servant who led Iowa's Department of Human Services was forced to resign in June, just one business day after he sent an email to more than 4,000 agency employees that included an inspirational quote from the rapper Tupac Shakur. He used his love of rap from time to time to \"reach out to our staff, tell them that I'm human, have a little levity,\" he tells NPR. Foxhoven regularly held \"Tupac Fridays\" in his office, where the rapper's music was played \u2014 the lawyer said he liked breaking stereotypes about who listens to rap. Jerry Foxhoven, the former head of Iowa's Department of Human Services, who was abruptly removed from that position in June. Courtesy of Jerry Foxhoven hide caption \"I'm a 66-year-old white guy from the Midwest who likes rap music, who likes Tupac!\" he says. In fact, Foxhoven is a Tupac superfan. The civil servant is utterly dedicated to the slain rapper, celebrating his birthday with Tupac-themed baked goods; marking Tupac milestones (\"I might seem a little down because today is the 22nd anniversary of 2Pac's death,\" he wrote once to a staff member); and assigning Tupac as mandatory reading for his ethics class at Drake University. But Foxhoven's tenure at the Department of Human Services ended without warning \u2014 and without a chance for an orderly transition. After his email citing the rapper, Foxhoven was asked to resign. He says that he was not even granted a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. Instead, the governor's chief of staff confiscated his cell phone and ID card on the spot and ordered him not to go back to his office. They did not cite a reason, and Foxhoven was not made aware of why he was let go after two years on the job. Foxhoven was aware that at least one individual was not a fan of his Tupac quotations. In an email, one of his staff members alluded to the existence of a disgruntled employee, who then reported his Tupac references to state legislators. These emails indicate that action may have been taken due to his Tupac-related messages. \"I am going to hang in there on him \u2014 despite all the naysayers,\" he wrote in one email, after a staff member said that there were \"haters\" who didn't appreciate his Tupac quotes. Although he knew one employee had complained about his frequent references to Tupac, Foxhoven says he hopes they were not the reason he was forced to resign. He does wonder, however. Foxhoven points out that Barry Manilow's birthday is one day after Tupac's, and wonders whether he have been dismissed if he had cited Manilow instead. Email sent by Jerry Foxhoven to Iowa Department of Human Services staff. NPR hide caption Email sent by Jerry Foxhoven to Iowa Department of Human Services staff. \"I always try to assume the best of everybody, and I can't imagine that [the governor] would base her decision on the Tupac incident,\" he says. \"If this is the reason, I'm really disappointed.\" The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment from NPR. But according to the Associated Press, the governor's office would not confirm or deny that Foxhoven's rap references were part of the reason for Foxhoven's dismissal. \"She wanted to go in a new direction,\" the governor's spokesman previously said in a statement, according to Iowa Public Radio. The spokesman provided no specifics. NPR made a public records request in order to obtain emails involving Foxhoven and his references to Tupac. Foxhoven's Tupac emails were first reported by the AP. The email which preceded his ouster was a positive one, in which he recognized Father's Day, Tupac's Birthday and his own work anniversary. \"Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back,\" he wrote, citing Tupac. \"It simply means that you are 2 steps ahead.\" In that same email, he praised his staff, writing that it was \"absolute honor to lead such a dedicated and committed group of people.\" In response, more than a dozen employees at the agency wrote back to praise him for the positive message. \"You are such a breath of fresh air, Jerry!\" wrote one staff member in response, according to emails obtained by NPR. The hundreds of pages of emails reviewed by NPR show that by all accounts Foxhoven was widely admired by his staff and regularly took time to mentor subordinates. In one email he dispensed career advice, noting that he was inspired at the agency by the well-known Tupac song \"Changes.\" Tupac-themed baked goods, brought to the office by staff to celebrate Mr. Foxhoven's birthday NPR hide caption In fact, he regularly cited Tupac in staff and agency-wide emails \u2014 including a Valentine's Day email in which he marveled, \"isn't it wonderful that we have a day to celebrate love?\" This observation was followed by a quote from Tupac's \"Dear Mama.\" The 66 year old's inbox even included a meme that referenced Tupac's famous collaboration with Dr. Dre, \"California Love.\" Ultimately, Foxhoven tells NPR he's glad that his emails about his favorite musical artist have now made national news, because it allows for a discussion about stereotypes and music. He said he was especially disturbed by a recent news story which reported that a 17-year-old boy in Arizona was fatally stabbed by a man who said the victim's rap music made him feel \"unsafe.\" \"It's important for us to break down those stereotypes: if you listen to rap music, you're a criminal or dangerous. It's not true at all,\" he says, adding that he hoped his situation could lead to \"having open discussions about race and what we have in common, instead of what separates us.\" He first got into Tupac in the early '90s when the rapper was still alive \u2014 \"we're going to have to get into this East Coast, West Coast thing,\" he says apologetically, as he explained his preference for the Californian musician. \"Part of the reason I like Tupac [is that] it's good music \u2014 it's not just rap with a bass in the background. It's fun to listen to, and also I liked over his career, you could see him transform.\" Foxhoven turns 67 next week, and is still figuring out what to do next. He wouldn't mind seeing the Tupac hologram in person, he says. One thing is for sure: \"I will be listening to some Tupac on my birthday. That's totally true.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a religious freedom summit at the Department of State on Tuesday. Pompeo is headed to Argentina, which is expected to announce it's joining an international coalition to counter Iran. As the United States has struggled to build support among its traditional allies in Europe to combat what it calls Iran's aggression, it has been forced to look elsewhere, such as Latin America, for support. This week, the Argentine government plans to designate the militant group Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, giving the Trump administration another ally in its push to build an international coalition to confront Iran. Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, is supported by Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Argentina later this week to take part in events honoring the 25th anniversary of the bombing of a Jewish Center in the Argentine capital, according to two sources familiar with details of the visit. \"This is going to make the United States very happy,\" said Seth Jones, a former Pentagon adviser who studies counterterrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The U.S. is having problems right now building a coalition against Iran.\" In Buenos Aires, Pompeo will participate in the second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial, aimed at highlighting challenges of terrorism in the hemisphere. Pompeo will also visit Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico and make a stop in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. The State Department didn't immediately respond to specific questions about Argentina's plans, but a senior State Department official discussing the trip said Tuesday that the administration wants Latin American countries to name and impose sanctions on terrorist organizations. \"We want to adopt a communique, the details of which will include things like a call for domestic designations regimes throughout the region so that countries have the same capabilities the United States does to impose sanctions on terrorist organizations and their financiers,\" the official told reporters. \"So over the short run we would like to see more countries adopt those laws, and over the longer run we would like to work with countries in the region to do joint designations of terrorists.\" As an example, the officials pointed to the establishment of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, where the United States works with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to combat terrorist financing. It includes a number of joint designations that target groups like Hezbollah and ISIS. Last month, President Trump said the U.S. was \"cocked & loaded\" to strike Iran. He stopped the strikes 10 minutes before they were to be launched \u2014 a move that could have accelerated the path to war. Soon after, Pompeo began a new effort to build an international coalition against Iran. But European leaders have resisted the United States' \"maximum pressure campaign\" against Iran. Several European nations do not want the United States to abandon the pact aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program. French and German leaders have continued to push to make reducing tensions a priority. Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, warned that \"the risk of war in the Gulf has not been averted.\" Instead of Europe, the secretary of state kicked off his coalition-building tour with visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that had been working to limit Iran's influence in the region. Now Pompeo will visit Latin America. Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich appeared to confirm plans to include Hezbollah on the designated list of organizations last week during a meeting with reporters following Cabinet meetings. \"What we are working on is the list to be composed of organizations with specific allegations,\" Bullrich said. \"In this case there are red alerts, we adhere to the list of the United Nations and we will add those terrorist organizations who have had activity in Argentina.\" Senior officials say the timing is not a coincidence. Pompeo's trip coincides with events honoring the victims of the 1994 bombing of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina, or AMIA, in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people. Buenos Aires prosecutors have charged Hezbollah with carrying out the bombing with Iranian support. The visit also comes as the center-right Argentine government of President Mauricio Macri positions itself for a reelection campaign this fall and is eager to signal its support from the U.S. Jones said the designation will be important for the Trump administration politically considering the challenges it has had generating international support. But he said it's unclear what concrete effects it will have on putting pressure against Iran. Benjamin Gedan, who was National Security Council director for South America during the Obama administration, said the designation will put pressure on other governments in Latin America that have been reluctant to take unilateral action against Iran. \"Though not a global power, Argentina's traumatic experience with Hezbollah makes it a compelling partner in White House efforts to highlight Iranian misconduct,\" said Gedan, now a senior adviser to the Wilson Center's Latin American Program and the director of its Argentina Project. Argentina has suffered two attacks attributed to Iran and has long taken a hard line on Tehran. Argentina's president has also depended on the Trump administration's economic support. The United States also helped push for the International Monetary Fund to extend Argentina its largest-ever $57 billion emergency loan last year. \"Argentina's financial survival depends upon IMF support, and the U.S. is its biggest backer at the fund,\" Gedan said. Ambassador Nathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, spoke last week at the Wilson Center during a commemoration event for the bombing. He said U.S. officials will work with Argentine officials to help \"attack the nexus between transnational crime and terrorism.\" He also promised future announcements. \"Secretary Pompeo recently emphasized that 'Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terror,' \" Sales said. \"It was true in 1994 and it's true now.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Trump's Racist Rhetoric Takes America Back Again : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The president's racist tweets tapped into one of the oldest strains in American politics - the fear and vilification of people perceived as other. That could be people of color, immigrants or, really, anyone unlike the speaker. NPR editor and correspondent Ron Elving is here to talk with us about this history. Hi, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Ari. SHAPIRO: You wrote on NPR.org that President Trump with his comments to the Democratic congresswomen was, quote, \"taking America back to where it came from.\" What do you mean by that? ELVING: I'm playing on the words of the president saying that these members of Congress should go back where they came from. SHAPIRO: Sure. ELVING: Nativism is as American as apple pie, Ari. It has been with us back to the early days of the republic. There was feeling against foreign-born citizens even then. They put it in the Constitution that a foreign-born person couldn't ever be president of the United States. And it took on a different form as more and more people did arrive from other countries, and people became fearful of those waves of immigration. SHAPIRO: And that extends beyond people who were born in other countries to people who are perceived as other. Three of the four congresswomen here are born in the U.S. ELVING: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: What were the peak periods of American nativism throughout U.S. history? ELVING: There were surges at several points in our history, beginning in the 1830s and 1940s, when famine and political upheaval in Ireland and Germany sent a huge influx of people into the country. And these people were Catholic, whereas most of the Americans at that time were Protestant, overwhelmingly. And also, they were arriving in such numbers that they disturbed people. So we go from fewer than 2 million foreign-born people at one point in the 1840s to, suddenly, within the decade, twice that many. And that was seen as fearful. It was seen as taking away jobs. But it was also seen as a threat to people's social order. And then, of course, you get another wave toward the end of the 1800s, early 1900s that came from all other parts of Europe - Eastern Europe, southern Europe. And in the 1920s, nativist feeling was so strong they passed a very restrictive immigration act in 1924, and they ignored the results of a census that showed these big influxes of immigrants had made the cities more populous than the countryside. SHAPIRO: And during these periods that there were all of these attacks on immigrants, did you also see attacks on people like the congresswomen today who are not immigrants, but are perceived as being different, just in the same way that President Trump in one breath attacks people crossing the border from Mexico and in another breath attacks people born in the U.S. who are brown or black? ELVING: The identification here of people who are different from whatever the perception of the old American, the true American - that's really what's crucial here. It really doesn't depend where you came from if you are perceived as being the other - for example, people who moved north in the Great Migration of African Americans in the 20th century, leaving behind the Southern states, moving to the north. And they were marginalized, and they were put in ghettos. And they were denied many of the opportunities of society and perceived as the other, even though they had been in the United States, at that point, for generations and generations. SHAPIRO: We've seen so many prominent figures use this kind of demonizing rhetoric. How unusual is it for a president? ELVING: Well, Calvin Coolidge, back in the 1920s, spoke of America becoming a dumping ground for undesirable people from other countries. So you have that kind of ugliness that far back. Richard Nixon had a very strong appeal to what he called the silent majority. He was clearly trying to speak to the sentiments of the white working class of his time, as opposed to both immigrant groups and also people of color in general. And then you have Ronald Reagan's approach, which was rather different. And in the immigration bill of 1986 - that reform bill actually granted amnesty to millions of people who were in the country without proper documents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: I'm going to do everything I can - and all of us in the administration are - to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. ELVING: And he thought it would finally give the United States full control of its borders. The amnesty worked, but it didn't really create the sort of border control that President Reagan thought it would. And it didn't do that much to discourage employers from bringing in and exploiting immigrant workers. SHAPIRO: So what stands out to you about President Trump's tapping this vein of American sentiment as being different from his predecessors? ELVING: Couple of things - one thing is that he personalizes it so much to individual people who are such high-identification citizens themselves - people who have actually been elected to Congress. That is highly unusual for a president of the United States. And also, it seems that even in Trump's own personal history as a politician - that he's gone from the birtherism when he was strongly suggesting that President Obama had not been born in the United States. That was, if you will, relatively subtle compared to where he was over this past weekend where he was highly personalizing and - if you will, the mask on his not only nativist sentiments, but racist.

Harris and Biden will again share center stage in the July 31 debate. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders is in the middle as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris face off in the June 27 debate in Miami. Harris and Biden will again share center stage in the July 31 debate. The lineup is now set for the second series of Democratic presidential primary debates, at the end of the month. On the first night, progressive favorites Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be on stage together for the first time, while upstart South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg will be trying to continue his improbable rise. On the second night, the marquee matchup will likely again be former Vice President Joe Biden versus California Sen. Kamala Harris, who had a nasty back-and-forth during their initial debate over Biden's past opposition to busing in some instances. It is also notable that with race playing such a big role not just this past week in politics with President Trump, but also in this Democratic campaign, that all of the candidates of color ended up being on stage together on the second night. That will make for odd optics on Night 1 and also potentially creates a difficult position for Biden, given the exchange over school integration in the first debate. The debates will be held on July 30 and 31 in Detroit from 8 to 10 ET each night. Moderators will be CNN's Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. Candidates for the July 30 debate: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and author Marianne Williamson Candidates for the July 31 debate: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and entrepreneur Andrew Yang Loading... NBC News, which hosted the first series of debates last month, also held a random drawing in order to determine the debate stage pairings, but it was held off stage and without much fanfare. CNN, however, hyped the potential face-offs to the highest drama, showing reporters shuffling names and then doing each drawing live (including from an overhead camera). The network did make sure with their lottery that the candidate division would be more equitable, based on polling, across both nights. The network divided the candidates into three buckets and drew participants from each \u2014 the four top-tier candidates (Biden, Harris, Sanders and Warren); mid-range hopefuls (Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Yang); and candidates who are mired near the bottom (Bennet, Bullock, de Blasio, Delaney, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Inslee, Ryan and Williamson). In order to make the debate, Democratic hopefuls had to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate had to register at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have reached 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both criteria. Major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just jumped in the contest last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who last week reversed his initial decision to pass on the race, also didn't qualify, given their late announcements. However, the benchmarks will get harder for the next debate in September. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Ilhan Omar, shown here at the Capitol on Thursday, has been a target of racist rhetoric from President Trump. Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the freshman Democratic congresswomen facing attacks from President Trump and his supporters, was cheered as she arrived back at her home district in Minnesota on Thursday. A crowd of people at the airport in the Twin Cities held banners with slogans such as \"Stop Racism Now\" and chanted \"welcome home Ilhan\" as the congresswoman emerged from her flight. \"We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president,\" she said into a megaphone, \"because his policies are a nightmare to us. We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready.\" Watch the moment captured on video by Tom Hauser of KSTP-TV: Congresswoman Omar just arrived back in the Twin Cities. pic.twitter.com/ZiFqWnDJgQ Throughout this past week, Trump has targeted Omar and her fellow progressive congresswomen \u2014 New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 with repeated attacks. In a tweet on Sunday, he said the four women of color should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" And at a rally on Wednesday, Trump attacked each congresswoman individually. As he spoke about Omar, the crowd started to chant \"send her back,\" echoing the president's tweet. Omar, an American citizen, came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia when she was a child. Trump attempted to distance himself from the racist chant on Thursday, saying \"I wasn't happy with that message that they gave last night.\" \"It was quite a chant, and I felt a little bit badly about it. But I will say this, I did \u2014 and I started speaking very quickly. But it started up rather fast,\" the president added. However, as NPR's Tamara Keith noted, \"in reality, Trump stood there for 13 seconds as the chant continued, waiting for it to die down before he resumed his remarks.\" Omar traveled to the Twin Cities on Thursday to participate in a town hall to discuss \"Medicare for All,\" as CNN reported. \"I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to let them,\" Omar told the crowd. Earlier in the day, Omar told reporters in Washington, D.C., that she sees the president as a \"fascist\" and said she considered this fight about \"what this country truly should be,\" according to The Associated Press.

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller testified during a Senate hearing in 2013. Lawmakers are studying old film to prepare for his hearings scheduled for next week. Updated at 12:45 p.m. ET Members of Congress likely won't confine themselves to former special counsel Robert Mueller's report when they question him next week in two open hearings, staffers said. Mueller, who is reluctant to appear, has said he would confine himself to what he's already written \u2014 but the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence won't. \"I would expect us to ask some questions that would require answers that are not necessarily in the four corners of the report,\" an intelligence committee staffer said. \"We do not expect him to violate any policies, laws or regulations. But there is no policy, law or regulation that says he cannot go beyond ... a report that he selectively wrote. There were obviously parts of the investigation that were not included ... so there's no reason why he can't discuss his investigation.\" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told reporters on Friday that he expected Mueller to stick by what he's said. \"He indicated his report was his testimony. It would be reasonable to assume that he meant what he said, but we'll see.\" The intelligence committee aides said they will focus on highlighting interactions between President Trump's campaign, WikiLeaks, and Russia. The special counsel's office documented an extensive number of contacts but did not establish a criminal conspiracy. Lawmakers on this panel would focus more on the evidence than on the legal conclusions that Mueller ultimately drew, aides said. Staff members on the intelligence and judiciary committees briefed reporters about their preparations for the hearings on the condition they not be identified. The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, is expected to note that Mueller's stated belief that his report is the testimony, but members will try to find ways to draw new insight by staying within the document. Democrats on the committee don't expect some \"big dramatic revelation,\" a Judiciary Committee aide said, but instead to \"have dots connected.\" Democrats want Americans to see and hear Mueller tell his story on TV in a bid to reach more people than have likely read his more than 400-page phone book of a report. Aides want the story to be told about the actions taken by President Trump and how the Justice Department's treatment of him differs from how they would treat any other individual. \"Any other American who did these things would be criminally charged,\" added another Judiciary Committee aide. \"We want every American to understand that you have a president who has committed the most serious kinds of offenses possible.\" Republicans, meanwhile, also are likely to seize the opportunity to try to induce Mueller to repeat stories embarrassing for the FBI or Justice Department. Trump supporters have spent months attacking federal law enforcement and Mueller personally. Committees divide questioning The two panels have divided the types of questions they'll ask. The House Judiciary Committee plans to focus on Volume II of the Mueller Report, which lays out the evidence for alleged obstruction of justice by the president. Judiciary Committee staff members said that they would highlight five or six specific incidents of possible obstruction of justice: \u2014 The president's direction to then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. \u2014 The president's direction to McGahn to deny that he ordered McGahn to fire Mueller \u2014 The president's direction to former campaign staffer Corey Lewandowski to deliver a message to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the investigation. \u2014 The president's direction to Lewandowski asking him to fire Sessions if he refused to comply. \u2014 The president's alleged witness tampering with regard to Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. Democrats also plan to draw attention to former White House counsel McGahn. \"Mr. McGahn is very much on our mind, as you'll see next week,\" said a Judiciary Committee aide. \"McGahn is the most frequently discussed, and the most important witness, from the perspective of the Judiciary Committee.\" The intelligence panel will focus on Volume I, which lays out Russian interference and the Russian government's links to the Trump campaign. \"What Volume I actually shows is that Russia did engage in a shocking attack on our democracy,\" said an intelligence committee aide. \"But even more so, that instead of going to law enforcement, the Trump campaign ... instead welcomed it, welcomed the help, and used the help, and even went so far as to build some of their campaign messaging around Russia's assistance.\" Aides said members of Congress would be careful to ask Mueller questions \u2014 as opposed to using their time to make statements \u2014 and aides from both committees said they have carefully studied the former special counsel's previous congressional appearances. They expect a lot of \"yes\" and \"no\" answers. \"He never gives a 10-word answer when a one-word answer will do ... so we're taking that into account as we prepare how to best elicit answers from him,\" a Judiciary Committee aide said. \"Part of our preparation is connecting the dots with a witness who does not want to be in this hearing in particular ... he does not volunteer information easily.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Domenico Montanaro President Trump continued his attacks on members of Congress during a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., Wednesday night. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images hide caption President Trump continued his attacks on members of Congress during a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., Wednesday night. The racist rhetoric from President Trump attacking four freshmen Democratic women, who he tweeted should \"go back\" to their countries of origin, escalated Wednesday night at his campaign rally in North Carolina. \"Send her back,\" the crowd chanted, during a riff in which the president criticized Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born American citizen from Minnesota. The president stood back for about 13 seconds before continuing on with his speech. He did not comment on the chant, which hearkened back to the anti-Hillary Clinton \"lock her up\" refrain, ubiquitous at 2016 Trump rallies. On Thursday, Trump said he tried to stop it, that he would try to do so in the future and that he disavows the chant. \"I was not happy with it,\" he said when asked about it at the White House. \"I disagree with it.\" But on Friday, Trump seemed to defend his chanting supporters, tweeting, \"It is amazing how the Fake News Media became 'crazed' over the chant,\" but \"is totally calm & accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by\" the congresswomen with whom he has been feuding. He referred to statements by three of lawmakers in his tweet, but there are four in the group \u2014 Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All four are U.S. citizens, and three were born in the United States. What's more, Trump also tweeted twice this week before his rally, \"If you are not happy here, you can leave.\" (Once, he did so in ALL CAPS.) So there appears to be some line of what's acceptable or not in the president's view, but it's relative. The next time that chant, or one like it, comes up at a rally, will Trump try to stop it? That's unclear but may be beside the point. What's clear is that this week highlighted \u2014 once again \u2014 that racial division and identity politics are going to be a major factor in the 2020 campaign and will almost certainly overshadow anything else that comes up. That should come as no surprise. Trump has used white grievance to fuel his political rise \u2014 from his role in the birther movement questioning former President Barack Obama's birth in Hawaii to his campaign kickoff when he said Mexico was sending rapists and drugs to the United States to his outsize focus on limiting immigration. He has used that grievance to sustain him in office \u2014 first, instituting a travel ban on people from countries that his administration deemed a threat (originally, they were all majority-Muslim countries), then wanting to require immigrants to \"speak English,\" to now using the go-back-to-where-you-came-from-if-you-don't-like-it line. And that could be why such a high percentage of Americans strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. This week's controversy also highlights the challenges the president faces in reelection, as he not only tries to find something to rally his base, but also attempt to plant doubt with independents about the direction Democrats want to take the country. Why the effort to elevate the four congresswomen? Trump and his campaign are trying to make the four congresswomen the faces of the Democratic Party. Why? He knows that their liberal policies are at odds with Democratic leadership and unpopular in swing parts of the country, so Trump is trying to tie them together. He noted this week that his attack \"forced\" Democrats to rally around the women. The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four \u201cprogressives,\u201d but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats! For Trump, the choice is binary \u2014 if you defend the four congresswomen in any way, then you endorse all of their statements and policies. That's a slippery slope, but one Trump's campaign is happy to sled down. Just hours before Trump said he was \"not happy\" with the \"send her back\" chant at his rally, his campaign declined to distance itself from it. \"The Squad, as they call themselves, are now the leaders of the Democrat Party,\" campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NPR's Tamara Keith in a statement when asked whether the campaign would disavow it. \"Americans don't like it when elected officials consistently disparage this country. All the Democrats are pushing socialist ideas that are terrible for America. They are all the same.\" Trump's tweet about forcing Democrats to defend the four congresswomen and the campaign's initial response to the rally chant make the political strategy plain. Facing reelection, the president hasn't done much to reach out beyond his loyal base of supporters, who still very much support him, but he needs to win over independents. So he's trying to make them think Democrats and their most extreme wing are one and the same while Democratic presidential candidates duke it out in their primary. In other words, define Trump's eventual opponent as too far left for the country even before there is a nominee. Independents have been a bright red flashing warning light for this president For much of the two-and-a-half years since Trump became president, independents have tracked with Democrats on many issues (except on the question of whether to begin impeachment proceedings). That support from independents helped propel Democrats to take back the House in 2018, and independents are especially vital for Republicans to win in presidential elections. Just how much? Republicans have won independents in seven of the last 11 presidential elections, and they won five of those elections. The 1976 and 2012 races were the exceptions. Mitt Romney won independents by 5 in 2012, but lost the election. In 2016, Trump won them by 4 points, according to exit polls, but lost the popular vote. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. That demonstrates the need, even more so, for Republicans to win independents, who have become a larger share of the electorate \u2013 31% in 2016 versus 26% in 2004. Trump is personally under water with independents. While he saw his highest quarterly approval rating on average this past quarter, according to Gallup \u2014 with an average of about 43% \u2014 that's still lower than his percentage of the vote in 2016 (about 46%). Dragging him down? Just 35% of independents approved of the job he's doing. So it's no surprise that Trump is grasping for something to sway them. The GOP and conservative media have been vilifying Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, in particular \u2013 and a poll, leaked by Democrats, showed just how much Democrats don't want them to be the focus. It found that both Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are fairly well known and unpopular with \"swing voters,\" whites without a college degree in swing House districts. But what else is unpopular with independents and swing voters? Racism, or at least the appearance of it. That could explain why Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the head of the committee tasked with electing Republicans to the House, said at a breakfast with reporters Thursday of the chant, \"There's no place for that kind of talk. I don't agree with that.\" The fact remains that while Democrats are trying to figure out their way forward, Trump also has a lot of work to do to win reelection in 2020. His campaign is banking on another very close election, one that sees a similar path to his victory in 2016. And remember, that only was decided by 78,000 votes across three Upper Midwest states \u2014 and Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. So strap in. This next election is going to be a turbulent ride for a country whose moral fabric is already being stretched perilously thin.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump rephrased some racist remarks without changing the meaning. He said that four lawmakers should go back where they came from and then said if they don't like America, they can leave. The lawmakers, for the record, are Americans elected by Americans. And NPR's Tovia Smith visited the district of one, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: As President Trump was dismissing criticism of what he said, he was also insisting that, quote, \"a lot of people love it.\" But in deep blue Massachusetts, not so much. D L POLONSKY: He's racist. He's psychotic. He's destroying democracy. SMITH: D.L. Polonsky (ph) wears a \"Deport Trump\" button in Allston, a gritty neighborhood of Boston that's represented by African American Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. An anti-Trump political cartoonist, Polonsky says he's offended by the president's latest comments but not surprised. He sees it as a deliberate political stunt meant to rally Trump's base. POLONSKY: He's just trying to distract. He's just gaslighting. And he's just a disruptor. SMITH: Around the corner at a neighborhood bar, bartender Sarah Leib says Trump has hit a new low - again. He's dragging down the public discourse, she says, and jacking up resentment among white Americans. Take the guy the other night who she refused to serve because he was already drunk. SARAH LEIB: He's like, you won't serve me because I'm a white male. I'm like, dude, like - (laughter) there's - yeah, I've never seen anything like that. SMITH: Leib says Trump is completely unfair to attack any member of Congress for criticizing policies. LEIB: That's what they're supposed to do. I mean, they're doing their job, and they're doing it effectively. But his ego is so fragile and thin, he says some asinine thing, that now that's in the news. SMITH: On the upside, 23-year-old Ana Maria Arabanos says the whole uproar is focusing positive attention on the squad, including her Congresswoman, Ayanna Pressley. ANA MARIA ARABANOS: And I'm grateful that we do have leaders that are representative of me, like, being a woman of color, who are standing up to him. SMITH: Across the bar, 60-year-old Republican Chris Kennedy, who voted for Trump, sees a different upside. He doesn't like the president's comments, but he is happy that Trump is drawing attention to issues like immigration policy. CHRIS KENNEDY: I think as negative as he is and as much of a troublemaker as he is, he is contributing to a very positive forward momentum because politicians behind him will have no choice but to focus on these issues that he has pushed to the surface. SMITH: Fifty-four-year-old Bill Rhoades, who's in town on business from Connecticut, is also a Trump fan but only, he says, because he purposely does not follow Trump's tweets. BILL RHOADES: You can't let it bother you because, I mean, he says stupid stuff every week. But as long as he's doing a good job, then that's good. I mean, my stock has soared. The economy's doing well. SMITH: All that counts more, Rhoades says, than what he sees as Trump's questionable comments. RHOADES: Unless he's actually called them out on their race, I don't think it's racist. I mean, I've heard other people say stuff like that too. ALAN WALTER: That sounds like something I'd say too. SMITH: Sixty-five-year-old Alan Walter says he sees it as a plus that the president doesn't cow to political correctness. And he points his criticism at the Democrats, who he says are playing the race card. WALTER: You know, the racist thing is so burnt out, man. It's such a lame label. Just - oh, just say, oh, he's a racist. It's the easiest thing to do. SMITH: But Walter also agrees with Trump critics on one thing, that the president's controversial comments are less a slip of the tongue than a deliberate strategy he hopes will win him a second term in office.

The House passed a resolution condemning his comments on Tuesday. J. Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption From left, Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York respond to attacks by President Trump in a press conference on Monday. The House passed a resolution condemning his comments on Tuesday. Updated at 6:54 p.m. ET The House passed a resolution condemning President Trump's \"racist comments\" on Tuesday evening. The nonbinding resolution states that Trump's remarks directed at members of Congress \"have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" It goes on to declare that \"immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger\"; that the House is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression;\" and that it \"strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" The resolution is sponsored by Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who is Polish-born. Some of the co-sponsors also were born abroad. The resolution comes in response to Trump's tweets, starting Sunday and continuing into the week, in which he said that a group of Democratic lawmakers, all women of color, should \"go back\" to countries of their ancestry and that they \"hate\" America. Trump continued his broadsides against the four Tuesday, tweeting, \"Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!\" The four Democrats are Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All but Omar were born in the United States. Omar is a naturalized citizen from Somalia. Trump's comments have been widely condemned by Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers. The vote on the resolution presented GOP lawmakers with the choice of going on the record against the president, who is popular within the party, or going along with his latest incendiary remarks. Four Republicans and one independent voted in favor of the resolution. Read the full text below and see the document in its original form here. RESOLUTION Condemning President Trump's racist comments directed at Members of Congress. Whereas the Founders conceived America as a haven of refuge for people fleeing from religious and political persecution, and Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison all emphasized that the Nation gained as it attracted new people in search of freedom and livelihood for their families; Whereas the Declaration of Independence defined America as a covenant based on equality, the unalienable Rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and government by the consent of the people; Whereas Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional convention, \"When foreigners after looking about for some other Country in which they can obtain more happiness, give a preference to ours, it is a proof of attachment which ought to excite our confidence and affection\"; Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \"Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists\"; Whereas immigration of people from all over the Earth has defined every stage of American history and propelled our social, economic, political, scientific, cultural, artistic, and technological progress as a people, and all Americans, except for the descendants of Native people and enslaved African-Americans, are immigrants or descendants of immigrants; Whereas the commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents; Whereas American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good; Whereas President John F. Kennedy, whose family came to the United States from Ireland, stated in his 1958 book \"A Nation of Immigrants\" that \"The contribution of immigrants can be seen in every aspect of our national life. We see it in religion, in politics, in business, in the arts, in education, even in athletics and entertainment. There is no part of our nation that has not been touched by our immigrant background. Everywhere immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life.\"; Whereas President Ronald Reagan in his last speech as President conveyed \"An observation about a country which I love\"; Whereas as President Reagan observed, the torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom and represents our heritage, the compact with our parents, our grandparents, and our ancestors, and it is the Statue of Liberty and its values that give us our great and special place in the world; Whereas other countries may seek to compete with us, but in one vital area, as \"a beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws the people of the world, no country on Earth comes close\"; Whereas it is the great life force of \"each generation of new Americans that guarantees that America's triumph shall continue unsurpassed\" through the 21st century and beyond and is part of the \"magical, intoxicating power of America\"; Whereas this is \"one of the most important sources of America's greatness: we lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people \u2014 our strength \u2014 from every country and every corner of the world, and by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation\"; Whereas \"thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we're a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge\", always leading the world to the next frontier; Whereas this openness is vital to our future as a Nation, and \"if we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost\"; and Whereas President Trump's racist comments have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color: Now, therefore, be it resolved, That the House of Representatives \u2014 (1) believes that immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger, and that those who take the oath of citizenship are every bit as American as those whose families have lived in the United States for many generations; (2) is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression, and those who are willing to work hard to live the American Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity, faith, or country of origin; and (3) condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should \"go back\" to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as \"invaders,\" and by saying that Members of Congress who are immigrants (or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America.

Zach Gibson/Getty Images hide caption President Trump gestures to the crowd during a Keep America Great rally in Greenville, N.C. on Wednesday. Updated at on July 18 at 1:52 p.m. ET President Trump continued his attacks against four freshman Democratic congresswomen at a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday, with the crowd breaking into a chant of \"send her back\" against one, echoing the president's racist message from the weekend. Trump on Thursday disavowed the chant. But Wednesday night, Trump piled on Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia as a child. Egged on by several false explosive claims against the Muslim congresswoman, Trump's supporters broke into the chant. It's the latest fanning of flames by Trump after he tweeted on Sunday that the four progressive members \u2014 Omar, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four are American citizens who are women of color, and all except Omar were born in the United States. Trump has repeatedly refused to apologize even as the House passed a measure condemning his remarks. Omar responded in a tweet on Wednesday night, quoting the late Maya Angelou by saying, in part, \"You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.\" You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.-Maya Angelou https://t.co/46jcXSXF0B Asked if the campaign would disavow the \"send her back\" chant, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement: \"The Squad, as they call themselves, are now the leaders of the Democrat Party. Americans don't like it when elected officials consistently disparage this country. All the Democrats are pushing socialist ideas that are terrible for America. They are all the same.\" Later in the afternoon on Thursday, a reporter asked Trump directly why he did not stop the chant. He said, \"I started speaking very quickly.\" Trump did not chastise the crowd at the rally and paused for several seconds while the chant was audible. \"I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,\" he said Thursday in the Oval Office. Crowd at tonight's Trump rally in North Carolina breaks out into chants of \"Send her back!\" as the president attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/0q5L39W61h During Wednesday night's rally, Trump ticked off his alleged grievances with each of the four women, painting them as taking anti-American stances. With Ocasio-Cortez, he said her name was too long to learn how to say and simply called her \"Cortez.\" \"They're always telling us how to run [the country]... you know, if they don't love it, tell 'em to leave it,\" Trump said. Community response to Trump's attacks While the Trump-friendly crowd may have cheered his doubling down on his racist remarks, that sentiment isn't shared throughout the greater city of Greenville and on the campus of East Carolina University, where Trump's rally was held. Trump narrowly won North Carolina, but he lost Pitt County, which is about a third African-American and about 6% Latino. Pastor Kenneth Hammond stands in the sanctuary at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville. Madeline Gray for NPR hide caption Pastor Kenneth Hammond stands in the sanctuary at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville. Kenneth Hammond is the interim pastor at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church, an African American community of worship which was burned to the ground by an arsonist in 1969. Hammond said Trump's language was unmistakable, and was a trope frequently used during the fight for civil rights. \"We as a people and we as a congregation have had firsthand experiences on how racist activities can impact people of faith... When you hear the rhetoric of going back from where you came from \u2014 for many of our folk, that's two blocks from here, so we are well invested in this country,\" Hammond said. \"The contributions that we've made to the success of this country are well-documented.\" Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Madeline Gray for NPR hide caption Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Trump has argued, and did again on Wednesday night, that Democrats are the ones using extremist language, but Hammond said that argument doesn't hold water. \"If it barks like a dog, it looks like a dog. It's a dog. And so it's it's it's racist is racist at its worst level,\" the pastor said. Even some of Trump's supporters in Greenville were dismayed by the tweets, such as Emma Arndt, chairwoman of the newly-formed College Republicans on East Carolina's campus. \"He had a moment. I think that he made a mistake but I think that he can build from it. And I think that he can maybe work on his initial tweets and stuff like that,\" said Arndt, who was at the rally registering voters. Trump delivers 2020 message Much of the rest of the rally was standard Trump fare, but there was a clear emphasis on women at the rally even as the president was on the attack against multiple Democratic women. Fresh off the launch of \"Women for Trump\" this week, signs with that slogan dotted the crowd. The president touted how well the economy was doing for women especially, and he hammered home the country's strong economic success overall \u2014 something most Republican strategists wish he would make more of his main emphasis instead of insults and stoking other controversies. As he usually does at rallies, Trump relived his unlikely 2016 election victory and condemned the \"witch hunt\" against him, even using profanity. This rally was originally scheduled to coincide with former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill, but that has now been delayed for one week. Trump did revel in the failed vote to move forward on articles of impeachment earlier today in the House, which was handily defeated by both Republicans and Democrats. \"That was a slaughter,\" Trump said, conceding that he did \"have to thank most of the Democrats\" for their votes. Many of the Democratic members who voted no want to go through a full process of investigations and hearings before voting. A merchandise truck sits in the parking lot of the Williams Arena before a rally with President Trump in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday. Madeline Gray for NPR hide caption A merchandise truck sits in the parking lot of the Williams Arena before a rally with President Trump in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday. Trump did turn his attention toward some of his potential 2020 rivals. He mocked former Vice President Joe Biden's lackluster debate performance last month, reviving his nickname of \"Sleepy Joe.\" Trump reveled in Biden's polling slide after California Sen. Kamala Harris's attack against him in last month's first debate about his past opposition to mandated busing in the 1970s. Trump did note that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who he again referred to as \"Pocahontas\" was rising. And he also mocked the pronunciation of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg's name and said he was unprepared to be president.

Jens Schlueter/Getty Images hide caption An Amazon warehouse in Leipzig, Germany. The European Union's antitrust arm will evaluate the company's role as both a retailer and a marketplace for other retailers. Updated at 3:07 p.m. ET Does Amazon hurt competition by exploiting data from other sellers in its marketplace? The European Union has opened a formal antitrust investigation into the giant online retailer to answer that question. This is the latest push in the expanded focus by European and U.S. authorities on how tech giants \u2014 Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon \u2014 use the data of people and businesses that rely on their platforms. The EU last year led the charge with a new sweeping privacy law. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it will specifically focus on how Amazon uses data collected from third-party sellers that use its marketplace. The commission will look at how that data might be used to Amazon's own advantage or in other anti-competitive ways. \"E-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices. We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behaviour,\" Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, the EU's antitrust chief, said in a statement. Amazon, in its own statement, said: \"We will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\" The commission has been collecting information from sellers and manufacturers in recent months. Based on those preliminary facts, it said, \"Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information \u2014 about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\" (Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters.) If the EU finds that Amazon violated competition rules, the company could face tens of billions in fines and requirements to change how it operates. The probe could also be dropped. On Wednesday, German antitrust regulators announced an agreement with Amazon to settle their own investigation into the company's marketplace. Amazon will make changes to the business terms it offers sellers, not just in Germany but worldwide. In March, the European Commission hit Google with a $1.7 billion fine for \"abusive practices\" in online advertising. The commission said Google abused its market dominance by keeping its rivals from working with firms that had deals with Google. In 2016, European Union regulators ordered Apple to pay a tax bill of $14.5 billion on its European profits earned in Ireland. EU regulators said the tax arrangement between Apple and the Irish government was illegal and gave the company an unfair advantage. And in 2017, the EU ordered Amazon to pay $295 million in back taxes to Luxembourg. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has reportedly approved a $5 billion settlement with Facebook to end an investigation into the tech giant's privacy missteps. Big Tech and other large corporations also have been criticized by Democratic presidential candidates. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

The world's largest container-shipping company, Maersk, has promised to make its operations zero carbon by 2050. Doing so will require using new fuels such as hydrogen. John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images hide caption Container ships and other maritime vessels currently run on pollutant-intensive heavy fuel oil. The world's largest container-shipping company, Maersk, has promised to make its operations zero carbon by 2050. Doing so will require using new fuels such as hydrogen. The global shipping industry is enormous \u2014 thousands of ships carry billions of dollars of goods each year across nearly every ocean on the planet. Those ships run mostly on a particularly dirty type of fuel known as heavy fuel oil, or bunker fuel. It's thick and sooty, and when it burns, it emits sulfur and particulate matter that can cause respiratory illness. It also emits greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. \"If shipping was a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world,\" says Nerijus Poskus of the shipping technology company Flexport. \"About 3% of global emissions are released by ocean freight shipping.\" The industry is growing so steadily, he says, that it's projected to produce more than 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury if ships continue to burn the same fuel, which is a real possibility considering that most cargo ships are designed to last at least 30 years. Maritime shipping vessels like this coal-carrying ship are powered by enormous engines that burn thousands of gallons of heavy fuel oil every day when they're at sea. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption Maritime shipping vessels like this coal-carrying ship are powered by enormous engines that burn thousands of gallons of heavy fuel oil every day when they're at sea. Yet there are signs that the status quo is changing and that a new fuel could make cargo ships among the cleanest transportation methods on Earth. \"Things are changing, and they are changing quite fast, finally,\" Poskus says. The international body that helps create global shipping regulations has clamped down on emissions of some air-polluting substances when ships are in or near ports. The new regulations, which started going into effect in 2012 and which decrease limits dramatically in January 2020, require ships to significantly cut the amount of sulfur pollution they emit when they're near land. For the U.S., the regulations apply anywhere within 200 miles of its coastline. The easiest way to comply with the new regulations is to burn a different, less pollution-intensive type of diesel fuel. The fuel oil that ships burn produces air pollution, greenhouse gases and waste sludge. The crew of the Premiership, a bulk vessel owned by Seanergy Maritime, collects the sludge in 55-gallon drums on board. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption The fuel oil that ships burn produces air pollution, greenhouse gases and waste sludge. The crew of the Premiership, a bulk vessel owned by Seanergy Maritime, collects the sludge in 55-gallon drums on board. Additional increasingly stringent emissions standards are planned for the next two decades. The largest container-shipping company in the world, Maersk, announced in 2018 that it intends to make its operations carbon free by 2050, though it's still unclear how the company would achieve that goal. What is clear is that success will require new ships, new engines and \u2014 above all else \u2014 a new fuel. Old technology, new economy The search for a cleaner, more climate-friendly maritime shipping fuel has turned up two real possibilities: liquefied natural gas and hydrogen. Research at the U.S. Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories suggests that of the two, hydrogen is the most promising. Using hydrogen to generate electricity is very clean. Hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen and create electricity and water. The electricity can be used to turn a propeller, for example. The exhaust from fuel cells is moist air \u2014 with no greenhouse gases. \"There's been a lot of interest in putting hydrogen fuel cells on boats,\" says Leonard Klebanoff, a researcher at Sandia. Around 2014, he and his then-research partner, Joe Pratt, started systematically analyzing whether current ships could be retrofitted to run using hydrogen fuel cells instead of fossil fuels. Pratt says the project started when a San Francisco Bay ferry operator asked the Energy Department whether it was possible to switch his fleet over to hydrogen power. Although hydrogen fuel cell technology has existed for decades, at the time no one in the U.S. had ever analyzed whether fuel cells could be used to power the world's shipping fleet. The answer, they found, was yes. The main issue was about size. For each unit of energy, liquid hydrogen is about four times larger by volume than conventional diesel, so many engineers worried that it might not be possible to fit enough fuel onto ships. Liquefied natural gas has a similar size problem and doesn't come with the zero-carbon benefits of hydrogen. But \"the efficiency of a fuel cell is about twice as much as a diesel engine,\" Klebanoff says, \"[so] you end up needing only about twice as much volume for the same endurance.\" And the gigantic internal combustion engines that currently take up lots of space on ships would be unnecessary on a vessel powered by hydrogen. When they analyzed the entire system, Klebanoff and Pratt found that it would be possible to retrofit most types of existing vessels to run on hydrogen and even easier to construct a new ship powered by fuel cells. \"The technology is all here,\" Pratt says. \"There's no reason why we couldn't make all these vessels zero emission today.\" In 2018, Pratt left Sandia to prove it. He co-founded a company called Golden Gate Zero Emission Marine, drew up detailed construction plans for a hydrogen-powered ferry and persuaded the state of California to contribute $3 million to fund a pilot project. The first hydrogen-fueled ferry in the U.S. is under construction in Oakland, Calif. Two hulls will support hydrogen tanks and fuel cells capable of powering the vessel without fossil fuels. Rebecca Hersher/NPR hide caption The first hydrogen-fueled ferry in the U.S. is under construction in Oakland, Calif. Two hulls will support hydrogen tanks and fuel cells capable of powering the vessel without fossil fuels. In May, inside a warehouse at a shipyard in Oakland, Calif., welders worked meticulously on the aluminum skeleton of a catamaran. The ship's hydrogen fuel tanks will sit on the deck and will power a propeller below. The ship's exhaust will be moist air, devoid of sulfur, soot and greenhouse gases. In fact, the drinking fountains on the ferry will feature water recycled from the exhaust system. When the ship \u2014 it's a passenger ferry \u2014 is finished this fall, it will be the first hydrogen-powered vessel to operate in the United States. It will be used to carry passengers across the San Francisco Bay and for tours of the area, and a Sandia National Laboratories team will study the vessel's performance. Hydrogen vessels in use by 2030? The quest to prove that hydrogen-powered vessels are viable is also underway in Europe. Hydrogen-powered vessels are under construction in Norway and France, also funded in part with public dollars. But Pratt sees signs that a commercial market for such vessels exists. He says that since his company formed, it has been contacted almost continuously by ship operators wanting to know more about hydrogen vessels. \"It's not just a few lab scientists thinking about it,\" he says. \"There are people out there who want it.\" Even so, Poskus says, it will be another decade before the shipping industry could begin to adopt hydrogen fuel cells. And, until there is more demand for fuel cell technology, hydrogen fuel will remain significantly more expensive than other, more polluting, shipping fuels. \"Technology is being tested. It's promising. I do think once it proves that it actually works, by 2025-plus, people will start ordering [new ships],\" he says. \"It takes three to five years to build a ship, so maybe by 2030 we will start seeing hydrogen ships.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: You know how in \"Star Wars,\" Jedi Knights can pick things up and make things move just by using their minds using the force? There are some scientists and computer programmers out there who are developing digital technology so that you can do that. This is the subject of the latest episode of our video series Future You, and Elise Hu has been trying it out. Hi there, Elise. ELISE HU, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How would it be possible in the real world to make things move just by thinking about them moving? HU: By reading the nerve impulses from your arm. So I went to the offices of a company called CTRL-labs, where they've developed an armband. It's the size of a wristwatch. And that can read the nerve impulses in your arm. And when you put it on, just by moving your hand or flicking a finger, you can make things happen on a screen or even in real life with physical objects. INSKEEP: In real life - like what? HU: OK. First, let's take the screen example. Picture a video game on the screen where there's images of objects, a whole world on there. And with this armband on, I could make a motion with my hand... JESSLYN TANNADY: You pull like this, kind of like, I want this to, like, come towards me... HU: ...Like I was grabbing something and picking it up or even pushing it away. And, on the screen, the object would respond. The engineer there, Jesslyn Tannady, taught me how to do this. TANNADY: Try pushing something far away using open hand. HU: Hold on. Oh. Oh... TANNADY: You got it. You got it. HU: OK. TANNADY: All right. Try - oh. Oh... HU: What am I - oh. TANNADY: Towards sky. Towards sky. Towards sky (laughter). INSKEEP: People will be a little familiar with the concept because they've seen video games like Xbox, where the device somehow reads your motion. But here, it's reading your thoughts? HU: That's correct. So this is a lot more sophisticated. And the other thing, Steve, is they've taken this beyond the digital world. They've devised ways that this armband will let you actually move physical objects - for instance, a robot. So this guy - this y'all call the hexapod? TANNADY: This is our little hexapod. HU: They have this little robot that looks like a mechanical spider, about the size of a football. And each of its legs represented one of my fingers. So I could open my hand to make it walk. Or if I held that robot behind my back and lined its legs kind of near my back there, I could scratch my own back. TANNADY: Give yourself back scratches. HU: OK. Hold on. Oh, whoa (laughter). INSKEEP: So assuming this works on a larger and larger scale, what does it mean for human beings? HU: The founder of this company says he wants this nerve impulse reading to fundamentally change the way we actually interface with our devices and machines. His name is Thomas Reardon. THOMAS REARDON: So, yes, an extension of you where interacting with a computer and a machine no longer feels like something you're doing mechanically, but instead is just a fluid extension of your thoughts and subtle movements. HU: So what he's saying there, Steve, is no more typing, no more swiping on your phone or even voice control. REARDON: All these things that we think of as the internet of things that all have their perverse little interfaces, like the Nest thermostat on the wall... HU: Right. Right. REARDON: ...There's no reason for me to go up and touch it and move it. I ought to be able to just look at it and change the temperature. INSKEEP: Sounds powerful and amazing. But in this series, Future You, Elise, you always ask what the downsides of things are. HU: Right. And privacy is a huge concern here because your neural identity is so specific to you. So the signals that we generate neurologically are the most unique identifiers of ourselves. Reardon puts it this way. REARDON: Give us 30 seconds of recordings from a person, and we can identify that person for the rest of their lives. And we have to make sure that people who might have the opportunity to exploit it, to track you and otherwise pervert your superpowers don't have an easy way to go do that. INSKEEP: It's like a fingerprint, only it's a neuro-print? HU: Exactly. And as with a lot of technology, we're making our lives a lot more fluid this way, and it would enhance what we can do. But it's opening up a lot of questions as we go forward too. INSKEEP: What can I do with this technology right now? HU: CTRL-labs is going to release a developer's kit. Other tech designers can make their device work with the armband. So maybe an auto engineer would be able to make a car that responds to your arm movements. And you'll be able to summon that car, or you could change your thermostat, like Reardon says. INSKEEP: Thanks, Elise. HU: You bet. INSKEEP: You can check out Elise trying the force - or more accurately, this CTRL-kit armband - in her latest episode of Future You with Elise Hu. It's at npr.org.

Vijay Kumar/Getty Images hide caption Apps like Find My Friends took several years to gain popularity. Many people were wary of sharing their location when it launched in 2011. One afternoon three years ago, Chelsey Vance decided to go for a walk. She took some ibuprofen before she left her Nashville, Tenn., apartment. She didn't know then that she was allergic to the medication. About halfway down the trail, she felt like she was going to faint. Vance sent her roommate her location through iMessage and asked the roommate to come pick her up. She soon began fading in and out of consciousness as she went into anaphylactic shock. \"I could feel my throat closing up, and I couldn't see anything,\" Vance says. \"I couldn't find my phone to call 911, because I guess I dropped it when I was passing out.\" Because her roommate had her exact location, the roommate was able to find Vance quickly and call an ambulance. Vance credits the location-sharing service as the reason she's alive today. She now uses apps like Find My Friends to share her location with her boyfriend and close friends indefinitely, so they can find her immediately in case anything like that happens again. Vance's story exemplifies one of the most obvious purposes of location sharing: safety. But it's used much more often in nonemergency situations. Modern relationships have become defined by the constant communication enabled by smartphones. Josh Constine, editor at large of the website TechCrunch, said constant checking-in through location sharing is the next natural step. According to Constine, launches of apps like Foursquare, in 2009, and Find My Friends, in 2011, were the start of mainstream location sharing. But at the time, many people were hesitant to share their location and thought twice before using these apps regularly. Location sharing had really taken off, Constine said, by the time Snapchat released, in 2017, its Snap Map feature, which shows users where all their contacts are anywhere on the globe. Today, people frequently opt to broadcast their whereabouts to their social circles, something that Constine said would have been a terrifying concept before smartphone technology. \"Now we all treat GPS as a critical utility,\" Constine told NPR in an email. \"Privacy and security norms continue to loosen. We don't think twice about staying in a stranger's house via Airbnb or riding in their car via Uber.\" Why should location-sharing apps be any different? NPR asked its readers why they share their location and with whom they share it. We received about 100 responses detailing a range of experiences with these apps. Many appreciate them. They said the apps provide peace of mind or at least make coordinating more convenient. People use them to manage the logistics of road trips or check if their roommate stopped at the grocery store on the way home. It does away with the need for updates through texts and calls \u2014 you can get an answer without disturbing anyone. Even if people haven't been in a situation where location-sharing apps directly contributed to their safety, many use them just in case. Calvin Jordan, who lives in Alexandria, Va., says that because he recently moved, he doesn't have a lot of friends and family members in the area. He feels better knowing that people closest to him have his location, even if they're hundreds of miles away. \"If I go out somewhere strange or it's late ... I'll go into a group chat with my sister and a friend of mine, people who have me on Find My Friends,\" Jordan says. \"I'll go, 'Hey, I'm here. I'm planning to leave at this time. If you don't see my little icon move, just give me a call or something \u2014 make sure I'm OK.' \" Several parents said they use the app to keep track of their kids, specifically their teens who drive. Joan Rose, from San Diego, uses Find My Friends to track her teenage son. She says the app reduces her worries when he's out late at night and allows her to see when he's on his way home. \"It's really, primarily, not to find out if he's up to no good,\" Rose says. \"I know my son. It's purely for safety.\" Some teens, on the other hand, expressed frustration at their parents' use of location-sharing apps to keep tabs on them and said it can feel restricting. No longer can they use traffic as an excuse for missing curfew \u2014 their parents know exactly where they were. Minor moments of tension are common consequences of location sharing, a standard one being the annoying revelation that the friend who promised they were on their way wasn't telling the truth. \"I would arrive at a place we were supposed to meet and could go on Find My Friends and see they hadn't even left their house yet or were just leaving,\" wrote Margo Morton of Louisville, Ky. \"It drove me crazy! I was scared to look sometimes.\" Additionally, unexplained appearances on the app can breed suspicion, instigate more serious arguments and, in some cases, even lead to stalking. One person wrote that he exposed his wife's affair when he tracked down the restaurant she was at with another man. Someone else said her unhinged ex used her location to find her at her place of work and cause a scene. The lines between legitimate and inappropriate uses of these apps, according to Constine, can be blurry. Overall, the responses reflected a common theme \u2014 that location sharing is a double-edged sword. These apps provide a constant source of useful information and, in instances like Vance's story, can be invaluable in emergency situations. But they're also rapidly changing social norms and revealing behaviors that people used to be able to hide. \"It kind of exposes the lies, which I guess is a good thing,\" Jordan says. \"But at the same time, it does kind of make you begin to question, well, what else could you be telling little fibs about in our relationship?\" Abigail Clukey is an intern on NPR's National Desk.

Bank of England hide caption The Bank of England's new 50-pound note will feature mathematician Alan Turing, honoring the code-breaker who helped lay the foundation for computer science. Alan Turing, the father of computer science and artificial intelligence who broke Adolf Hitler's Enigma code system in World War II \u2014 but who died an outcast because of his homosexuality \u2014 will be featured on the Bank of England's new 50-pound note. The new note will be printed on polymer and will bear a 1951 photo of Turing, the bank announced Monday. It's expected to enter circulation by the end of 2021. It will include a quote from Turing: \"This is only a foretaste of what is to come and only the shadow of what is going to be.\" Turing was just 41 when he died from poisoning in 1954, a death that was deemed a suicide. For decades, his status as a giant in mathematics was largely unknown, thanks to the secrecy around his computer research and the social taboos about his sexuality. His story became more widely known after the release of the 2014 movie The Imitation Game. \"Alan Turing was an outstanding mathematician whose work has had an enormous impact on how we live today,\" the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, said in unveiling the new note. \"Alan Turing's contributions were far-ranging and pathbreaking. Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.\" In the U.K., 50-pound notes are not commonly used in many daily transactions, and some retailers refuse to accept them. They've also been called the \"currency of corrupt elites,\" as the BBC notes. In recent years, other updates to the Bank of England's currency have featured Jane Austen on the 10-pound note and Winston Churchill on the 5-pound. A new 20-pound note is expected next year, bearing a self-portrait by the artist J.M.W. Turner. The Turing commemoration is the U.K. government's latest public reevaluation of the genius who was convicted of homosexuality under \"gross indecency\" laws in 1952. By the time he died, Turing had been stripped of his security clearance and was forced to undergo a \"chemical castration\" regime of estrogen shots to avoid serving a two-year prison term. According to biographer David Leavitt, who wrote a book about Turing titled The Man Who Knew Too Much, some of the persecution that Turing faced was due to the government's fears that he could become a security risk. It was a sharp fall for Turing, who had toiled in secret at Britain's military intelligence headquarters at Bletchley Park to help defeat an existential threat to his country. As for how Turing saw his own sexuality, Leavitt told NPR in 2012: \"His attitude was that it was perfectly normal and not a big deal. And so he behaved as if everyone else felt the same way, which was obviously a big mistake at that time.\" In astrophysicist Adam Frank's view, Turing's groundbreaking and important work was more than enough to earn a Nobel Prize \u2014 an honor Turing never received. Elaborating on Turing's achievements, Frank wrote for NPR: \"In 1935, at the ripe age of 22, Turing devised the abstract mathematical background to define a computing machine. Now called a 'Turing machine,' it would sequentially respond to input and generate output in a step-by-step (i.e., algorithmic) fashion. Turing machines are the essence of every device with a chip in it that you have ever encountered. That's why Turing stands, essentially, at the head of the line when it comes to the creation of the digital age. He is the father of all computers.\" The anti-homosexuality laws that snared Turing remained in effect until 1967. Queen Elizabeth II issued a royal pardon for Turing in late 2013. Three years later, the U.K. justice minister issued a mass pardon for thousands of gay men. \"It was a momentous day for all our family when we heard that Alan Turing was going to be pardoned back in 2013,\" Turing's great-niece, Rachel Barnes, told NPR in 2016. \"One of the best days ever, and we celebrated like mad. But the same pardon is deserved by everybody else.\" Those breakthroughs came after repeated attempts to secure a posthumous pardon for Turing in Parliament. When one such bid failed in the House of Lords, opponents of the measure said it wasn't appropriate, reasoning that Turing must have known he was breaking the law. In 2009, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a full apology to Turing, thanking him for his \"contribution to humankind\" and for fighting fascism and war. \"You deserved so much better,\" Brown said.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "Adam Frank Tales from Our Human-Robot Futures by David Ewing Duncan Hardcover, 303 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? We've been talking to robots for a while now. In the decade or so since Siri and her compatriots first appeared, we've all gotten pretty used to having conversations with computers in various forms. While your Alexa doesn't look much like a Cylon (the scary metal kind or hotty flesh kind) now, it seems like it's just a matter of time of time before we'll be talking with all kinds of robots \u2014 including those that look just like us. Time, robots and conversations are at the heart of David Ewing Duncan's new book Talking to Robots: Tales from Our Human-Robot Futures. And if you want to see what that future might look like, Duncan's book is a fun place to start. The book is written as a series of essays by an unnamed future historian about the rise of the bots in all their forms. The 26 chapters cover a lot of ground: Teddy Bear Bot; Doc Bot; Beer Bot; Warrior Bot; Politician Bot; God Bot and, of course Sex Bot. But Duncan is not really writing science-fiction as most of the chapters include interviews with scientists, engineers and other experts alive today (also known as the Early Robot Era or ERE). This allows Duncan to playfully explore the outlines, and outer limits, of far future human-robot relations while grounding those journey's in what's happening now. The use of real world (or ERE) experts pays off when it delivers surprising visions of our robot future. In the chapter \"Sex (Intimacy) Bot\" Duncan begins with the story you expect. People (OK, men) trying to design robots that are really just high-tech sex toys. This includes companies like Realbotix, based in New Jersey, selling \"Harmony AI\" \u2014 a highly customizable sex-doll-bot with \"next-gen artificial intelligence.\" But after detailing emerging phenomena like Japanese men who want to marry their sex-doll-bots, Duncan goes beyond mechanics to ask how bots might serve the deeper need for intimacy. Interviewing Australian sex-tech relationship expert Bryony Cole, the chapter asks more expansive questions leading to the idea of an \"intimacy bot\" which Duncan describes as \"a super-smart adviser and guide that would combine the insights of therapists, goddesses, and poets with a handy guide to all the possibilities around sex, with or without machines.\" The darker aspects of our emerging future make its appearance in chapters like \"Warrior Bot.\" Duncan provides a pretty chilling vision of the strides the military is already making along the road to fully autonomous killing machines. For this chapter, one of his guides is retired U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert Latiff, who is also a physicist. As Latiff explains, the military doctrine governing robot weapon systems, like drones, is that there must always be a human in charge. This leads Duncan in a prolonged exploration of what could happen if that doctrine were dropped. Should we try, as Latiff suggests, to build military robots that include algorithms for ethics? That, of course, begs the question of whose ethics gets programmed into our warrior bots. Duncan also goes past questions of just Terminator-style killing machines to explore biological hacking as a weapon, like using the president's DNA to build an undetectable virus that only targets him or her. Threats in cyber space get a focus as well, since future wars might be won without ever firing shot in the real world. The best part of Talking to Robots is it does not take itself too seriously. Discussing the loss of jobs to robots, Duncan describes the idea of easy work retraining with the equivalent of a knowing smirk: \"The automate-and-then-reboot\u2011a\u2011person's\u2011job scenario actually worked remarkably well, until it didn't. Many of us recall when the jobs began to disappear too fast for laid-off baristas to find work in the amazing new industries that were supposed to pop up as robots took over.\" Unfortunately, Duncan's central conceit \u2014 that these chapters are a history written from far in the future \u2014 often fails him. The structural demands of keeping the viewpoint anchored in the future while using interviews with experts alive today proves to be too much in many of the chapters, and the \"future history\" enterprise just collapses on itself. Other times, the research for the book seems a glib. In the \"God Bot\" chapter, Duncan interviews Brian Greene and uses String Theory as some ultimate frontier of physics. A little bit of research would have shown him that most physicists have been pretty disillusioned with String Theory as a \"theory of everything\" for awhile now. That means whatever cosmic thoughts God Bots think about in the future, they probably won't be String Theory. But taken as a whole, Duncan's book holds a lot of pleasures. It's funny and broad and, in its way, asks important questions. Interviewee Sunny Bates concisely sums up the whole bot-human situation in the job-loss chapter: \"Not long ago, people were optimistic that things would be better. Now we're wondering: How do we embrace the future, lean into it or lean away from it, or run away from it?\" I guess it depends on how fast the robots pursuing you can run.

        "title": "2 LGBTQ Former Dell Workers Share Stories Of Alleged Discrimination : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: In this country, there's a growing fight for the rights of transgender people. Over 200 companies, including tech giants like Amazon and Google, have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that federal civil rights law prohibit discrimination against gay and transgender workers. Now, recently, NPR learned of one woman's experience at the computer company Dell. She says she endured discrimination for years and filed a complaint with New York City's Commission on Human Rights. There are two other cases alleging discrimination at Dell. Dell denies liability in one case, and the other's ongoing. And Dell, we should note, is an NPR sponsor. Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Sometimes when she's frustrated, when she has some free time, Helen Harris comes here to blow off steam - a little warehouse Gym in Brooklyn. And these days Harris has too much free time and plenty of frustration, which led her to file a complaint. HELEN HARRIS: I know that my rights have been violated. GARSD: Harris is a 37-year-old systems engineer. Her job - selling technology to major companies and helping them set it up. NPR spoke to four colleagues Harris has worked with. They describe a talented young woman whose career was completely derailed a few years ago. And they, like Harris, suspect it's because of the way she looks. Harris is African American and gender-nonconforming. She was born and identifies as a woman. She uses feminine pronouns. She doesn't wear makeup or jewelry. She favors men's tailored suits and shoes and says, ultimately, that's nobody's business, which is why, in late 2015, when she started taking hormones to become more masculine-looking, she did it quietly. Besides, she always saw the tech industry as this place where, no matter what you look like... HARRIS: If you put your head down and you learn the stuff and you do the work, you can change your circumstances. GARSD: This was around the same time when Harris' company, EMC, was merging with Dell. Harris and several other employees were sent to training to step into new roles. She says that's when things started getting weird. She says she got heckled by co-workers when she gave presentations and that one of her instructors kept telling her, in order to work with customers... HARRIS: People have to like you for you to be able to do this job - he kept saying stuff like that to me. GARSD: Harris says her colleagues, the ones who were at that training where she had a hard time, they all moved up the ladder. She was told to keep on training. So she did - for three years. In her complaint to New York's Commission on Human Rights, Harris alleges that Dell didn't want to put her in front of customers because of how she looked. During that time, she says that she'd speak with managers, executives, colleagues, HR. HARRIS: What is the problem? Like, if there is a problem with me, like, what I'm doing, can someone please speak up? GARSD: So there's this idea that the tech industry is a place where stuff like this doesn't happen, where you can scooter into work, piercings, tattoos - no problem. As long as you work hard, it doesn't matter who you are. The diversity numbers at big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Apple tell a different story. Take Facebook - less than a quarter of tech roles there are held by women; African Americans make up only about 1%. At Dell, you get a complicated picture. On the one hand, the company has repeatedly been ranked among the 50 best for diversity. But several current and former Dell employees, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the New York office had the atmosphere of a boys club. A woman named Cicilia Gilbert, also a systems engineer at Dell, says it's not just New York - the tech sales culture in general can be brutal; she says it was for her. When Gilbert decided to transition from male to female, she says a trans co-worker warned her. CICILIA GILBERT: Don't tell these people that you're transgender; it's a career-ender. GARSD: Gilbert was devastated when, in late 2018, right in the middle of her transition, she was let go. GILBERT: They said, we're laying you off because your transgender transition is impeding your ability to travel. GARSD: Gilbert, who is 58, is suing Dell for, among other things, allegedly discriminating against her for her gender transition. The case is ongoing. It's not unusual for a company as large as Dell to have discrimination lawsuits. Jennifer Davis, a spokeswoman for Dell, told NPR that Gilbert's layoff had nothing to do with her gender; it was part of a restructuring where hundreds lost their jobs. And she pointed to the company's support network for trans employees. NPR spoke to two workers who say the extensive medical coverage and support Dell offers made their gender transition possible. But there was another case back in 2017 - the Massachusetts attorney general investigated a complaint from a former intern, also trans, who alleged discrimination. Dell denied wrongdoing but paid $110,000 in settlement. The last time I met with Harris at the gym in early June, she was still on Dell's payroll, but she wasn't even bothering with going into the office on a regular basis anymore. HARRIS: I have problems using the bathroom - that's the truth. After the second time I got harassed about which restroom I was using is when I stopped going. GARSD: Helen Harris says she's exhausted. A few weeks after we met, she quit. I asked Dell about her. Spokeswoman Jennifer Davis wouldn't provide details, saying she wishes to respect Harris' privacy. But she says the matter was resolved amicably. I asked Harris if she'd given up on a career in tech. She said, no way. HARRIS: I want my money. I don't want to be poor. Like, my father, he picked cotton. My grandfather was a sharecropper. I'm a systems engineer, so I'd rather stay. GARSD: She quit Dell, but she's not quitting tech. Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, New York.

The social media giant has helped develop a digital currency called Libra that plans to launch in 2020. Nichole Sobecki for NPR hide caption With a mobile phone, Kenyans can send and receive money via a service called M-PESA. Now Facebook is entering the digital currency realm. The social media giant has helped develop a digital currency called Libra that plans to launch in 2020. It's not easy giving money to people in need. In some countries, poor people may not have a bank account where a charity can transfer funds for financial aid. They may not have the ID \u2014 say, a birth certificate \u2014 required to cash a check at a bank. And in an emergency situation \u2014 say, the aftermath of an earthquake \u2014 banks may not even be operating. Could a single global digital currency \u2014 one that can be transferred through mobile phones \u2014 be a solution? That's the way that Libra will operate. It's a new currency incubated at Facebook and announced in June. Libra, according to its website, wants to \"reinvent\" money by making a financial transaction as cheap and simple as \"sending a text message or sharing a photo.\" The main goal isn't to help out in humanitarian situations. But Mercy Corps, one of the world's largest relief groups, is so impressed with the potential benefits that it established a partnership with Libra this spring. And it's a high-profile partnership. When a Facebook executive testified about Libra before members of Congress this past week, he mentioned the Mercy Corps connection as a way of building up Libra's credentials. But the partnership does raise questions. Not everyone in the aid sector is convinced that Libra will live up to its billing as a \"simple global currency\" \u2014 or that it's a good idea for a charity to form a relationship with Facebook, which is facing a $5 billion fine from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations. For the aid group, which operates in 40 countries struggling with conflict, natural disasters and economic instability, \"Libra opens up a lot of possibilities,\" says Ric Shreves, senior adviser of technology at Mercy Corps. \"We work in difficult places. It's hard to get money onshore. Imagine if you had access to a currency that was widely accepted throughout the world.\" One of the biggest reasons that Mercy Corps supports Libra is that it could help bring the world's 1.7 billion people without a bank account into the global economy. It even sees Libra as a way to pay local workers in its field operations. In some countries with unstable economies, the group brings in large sums of cash, a risky way to do business. Mercy Corps has long been seen by its peers as a leader in providing innovative financial solutions to the developing world. It has set up local microfinance banks in countries like Mongolia to offer small loans to people who otherwise wouldn't be eligible. And it has distributed cash aid in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, moving away from traditional types of aid like food or programs. When Facebook asked Mercy Corps if it wanted to be a member of the Libra Association, the group tasked to govern and develop the currency, Shreves believed it was the right move. \"We've been advocating in this space for several years,\" he says. \"When the Facebook opportunity came along, we were fortunate that we already had some familiarity with the topic.\" In 2017, Shreves wrote a white paper for Mercy Corps called \"A Revolution in Trust,\" which looked at how digital currencies like bitcoin could \"positively be used in the humanitarian and development sector to benefit the people we serve,\" he says. To understand the concerns about Libra, first you have to grasp how the currency will operate \u2014 although the plans are still being worked out. Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Libra will use a technology called blockchain to secure data about users and their financial transactions. But unlike bitcoin, Libra will be backed by real assets to help the currency stay stable. A basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities will be held in reserve for Libra coin to build trust in its value. To make the service accessible, Facebook created a subsidiary called Calibra in June to develop a digital wallet, similar to the Venmo or Paypal app. The wallet will be available in WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and as a standalone app. These features, say Libra, will help make the currency reliable and remove barriers for people to sign up for the service. The idea for Libra started at Facebook, and Facebook will be creating the infrastructure that allows people to use Libra on their phones. But Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications at the Libra Association, stresses that Facebook is not the owner. The social media giant is one of the founding partners of the Libra Association, a group of 28 members that include powerful corporate entities like Ebay, Mastercard, Uber and Visa. Mercy Corps is one of four nonprofits in the Association; the others are Kiva, Creative Destruction Lab and Women's World Banking. Each member \u2014 including Facebook \u2014 will have one equal vote in governing the currency and making key decisions on policies regarding consumer data and safeguards to protect against such problems as money laundering. And it will be the Association's task to get Libra in operation by 2020, says Disparte. Some in the humanitarian sector doubt Libra's viability \u2014 and wonder whether it is little more than a Utopian ideal. Libra was announced with only a white paper outlining its vision and mission statement, says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. \"Mercy Corps has certainly tried to be on the leading edge of some of these [financial] innovations,\" says Konyndyk, who worked at the aid group from 2008 to 2013. \"Sometimes that pays off. And sometimes it doesn't.\" One of the biggest concerns that Konyndyk has about the Mercy Corps' partnership is the lack of information about how the currency will work in the real world. \"They are basically betting by being involved at this early phase,\" says Konyndyk. Shreves acknowledges that there are huge barriers that Libra needs to overcome. For one, Libra will need to figure out how to exchange its coins into local currencies. So if the aid group gave money in the form of Libra to a refugee family in Syria, for example, that family could be able to turn that money into local cash. Otherwise, they will only be able to spend the digital currency at markets and shops at the camp that accept Libra \u2014 partnerships that would be worked out in advance with Mercy Corps. (The aid group uses similar models with its voucher programs at refugee camps.) And the Libra members will need to work out how much personal information users will have to disclose to use the currency. Shreves imagines that a user's digital identity \u2014 for example, having an account with WhatsApp or Facebook \u2014 could be enough to be eligible. Libra says that the Association will have to comply with global financial norms and regulations, including country-specific standards, on what kind of data users will have to provide. Some in the humanitarian community disapprove of Mercy Corps aligning itself with a controversial entity like Facebook. Over the past couple of years, the social network has been under fire for invasive data tactics and privacy violations. And it has recently been criticized for its inability to stop the spread of misinformation, which even Facebook acknowledges has contributed to recent violence in countries like Myanmar, Nigeria and Sri Lanka \u2014 countries where Mercy Corps works. But what technology specialists in the aid community are really concerned about are the tech industry's \"bait and switch\" tactics. \"They start [projects] that are seemingly benign, and then you find out they had a particular goal the entire time, says Linda Raftree, an independent consultant who advises international development groups on users' digital safety, security and privacy. For example, technology companies have shared or sold data to other companies or government agencies for commercial gain. Just like everyone else, poor and marginalized groups are vulnerable to being taken advantage of by tech companies, she adds. Disparte of Libra disagrees with this narrative. \"Mistrust in Facebook should not necessarily convey mistrust in Libra,\" he says. Protecting the interests of the poor is partially why Mercy Corps says it wanted an early seat at the Libra table. As one of the few nonprofit entities in the Association, the group hopes to represent the interests of its beneficiaries. The goal is to \"voice the needs of the most marginalized and financially vulnerable,\" says Pete Lewis, vice president of marketing and communications at Mercy Corps. Still, Raftree doesn't think Mercy Corps should be at the table at all. \"Humanitarian and development agencies should not be tools of the corporate sector to access new markets,\" she says. \"[Aid] agencies have a mandate to 'do no harm' and I'm not sure that a partnership with Facebook can fulfill that mandate given the power dynamics.\" Some critics, like Dragana Kaurin, a human rights researcher at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, believe that Libra is getting more out of the relationship than Mercy Corps. In a Medium post, \"Why Libra Needs A Humanitarian Fig Leaf,\" published in July, she wrote: \"Libra is being branded as a tool that will help millions around the world, and it needs Mercy Corps for this humanitarian washing.\" Disparte, the spokesperson from Libra, disagrees with this characterization. \"I reject [this] flatly.\" In order for the digital currency to reach its goal of being used by everyone \u2014 including people living in low-income countries \u2014 \"you need partners [like Mercy Corps] in the design and in the DNA of this project.\" Indeed, in that Congressional hearing this week, Facebook said that the nonprofit groups in the Libra Association are there to help safeguard against potential human rights abuses. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., asked Facebook executive and Calibra head David Marcus: \"How are you establishing appropriate human rights safeguards as you develop the Libra platform?\" Marcus responded: \"We will have the right representatives around the table ... we have Mercy Corps, Women's World Banking and Kiva that are founding members of the Libra Association.\" Disparte says that the Association hopes to bring in additional nonprofit groups as Libra works to bring the total number of so-called \"founding members\" to 100 over the next year. Financial experts in Africa have their own set of worries. Michael Kimani, chairman of the Blockchain Association of Kenya and a digital currency analyst based in Nairobi, worries that a global digital currency run by one of the biggest tech companies in the world is the modern-day equivalent of the British East India Company. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the British trading body enabled colonial activities in parts of Asia, China, India and Africa. \"Facebook [is] using the poverty trope that has been used and abused by NGOs, white missionaries and [colonizers] in the past to gain entry into Africa for commercial interests,\" he wrote in a blog post on his personal website in June. \"The Libra Association is a neo-form of colonization, where, the global rich northern countries and their corporations sit around a table and decide what is good for Africa,\" he wrote. The Libra Association, notes Kimani, is comprised of mostly American and European companies. Disparte of Libra says he \"rejects that neocolonialism\" narrative. \"This is really about empowering billions of people financially and putting them into the system rather than leaving them behind.\" Kimani worries what would happen if If Libra becomes widely adopted in Africa: National currencies could be destabilized, he says, and booming African mobile payment companies like M-PESA and Safaricom could be undercut. Libra could negatively affect the continent's whole financial sector, says Kimani. And lots of people are wondering about Facebook's role. \"If [Libra] is successful, Facebook will have even more data on people's communications, behaviors and financial habits. This chain will all be owned and controlled by a U.S. corporation,\" says Raftree, the technology consultant. Disparte says that the financial accounts of users and their social media accounts will be separate. When asked how Facebook will ensure that users' financial information will be kept private from data gathered for the social network, Marcus said to the Senate Committee on Tuesday: \"Within our infrastructure we have separated the data from the rest of Facebook's infrastructure and data in order for it to not get co-mingled.\" Despite the criticism and the massive hurdles the currency will have to face, Mercy Corps is excited by the revolutionary potential of a global currency. The aid group eventually hopes to receive some funding from the Libra Association to hire staffers to work on the Libra project full-time. But to date, Mercy Corps has received \"no money from Facebook or the Libra Association,\" wrote Lynn Hector, a media and communications manager at Mercy Corps, in an email to NPR. \"It's early days right now,\" says Lewis of Mercy Corps. \"We are trying to improve lives for people in the most challenging circumstances. We know that requires new approaches and new ways of working. We absolutely feel the pressure.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Global Shipping Is About To Get Greener : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Time now for All Tech Considered. And today we are considering how technology could make shipping cleaner. The vast majority of the things we buy in the U.S. come here on ships, often from countries oceans away. These ships run on a particularly dirty kind of fuel called heavy fuel oil, or bunker fuel. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports, that may be changing. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The inside of a modern ship smells like oil, and everything is enormous. ALEKSEI BUZLOV: So let's go down. HERSHER: Aleksei Buzlov (ph) is the chief engineer on a coal-carrying ship that I visited when it stopped in Baltimore earlier this year. Its engine room was a cavern four or five stories tall. Wow. There were layers of catwalks around an engine with pistons as long as station wagons. And built into the walls were rows and rows of bulbous storage tanks. BUZLOV: Fuel tanks - this one, 60 tons; another one, 80 tons - small tanks. HERSHER: Small because, in all, the ship carries about 300 tons of heavy fuel. The fuel is darker and thicker than diesel or gasoline. It looks kind of like the engine oil for a car. Aleksei spends a lot of his time down here cleaning gunk out of engine parts. BUZLOV: This is slop. HERSHER: Slop, the dark grease that heavy fuel leaves behind on basically everything it touches. Oh, it's like frosting - or poop. BUZLOV: Don't touch. HERSHER: Keeping the ship's engine clean enough to run efficiently is a never-ending job. This ship burns an average of 50 tons of heavy fuel every day when it's on the ocean. And in addition to the slop, as it burns fuel, the engine emits CO2, carbon dioxide, and soot into the atmosphere. Add that up across all the thousands of ships crisscrossing the Earth every day, and it's a lot of pollution. NERIJUS POSKUS: If shipping was a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. About 3% of global emissions are released by ocean freight shipping today. HERSHER: Nerijus Poskus is an analyst at the company Flexport. He says the shipping industry is growing so fast, it's projected to emit more than 15% of greenhouse gases by midcentury if ships keep burning heavy fuel oil, which is untenable if humans hope to avoid the worst effects of climate change. And the shipping industry appears to know that. POSKUS: Things are changing, and they are changing actually quite fast, finally. HERSHER: International regulators have tightened emissions standards for when ships are in port. And one big company, Maersk, has said they intend to make their entire fleet zero emission by 2050 - no greenhouse gases, which will require a new type of fuel. POSKUS: My personal opinion, hydrogen looks like the most promising way to power ships. HERSHER: Poskus thinks it will take at least a decade, partly because ships are designed to last about 30 years. But the first hydrogen-powered prototypes are being built now in just a few places on Earth. Norway is one of them. The other is Oakland, Calif. JOE PRATT: OK. So down here where he's working, you have the two holes. Right? HERSHER: Joe Pratt looks down at the shiny aluminum skeleton of a ship. It's on its way to being a passenger ferry, so you can see the outlines of what will be two catamaran hulls. PRATT: This is the floor. HERSHER: His company, Golden Gate Zero Emission Marine, is building it with money from the state of California. When it's finished in the fall, it will be the first hydrogen-powered vessel to operate in the U.S. Pratt says the technology is not particularly new. They're just proving that it can be used to power a boat. PRATT: Yeah, everything is off the shelf. HERSHER: One issue his team has had to figure out was how to make sure there was enough room for the hydrogen tanks and for the fuel cells. As big as internal combustion engines are, hydrogen fuel cells and their fuel will require even more space. One thing they don't have to worry about anymore, though - smelly exhaust. PRATT: It has an exhaust duct, which will have warm, humid air coming out. HERSHER: The moisture from the exhaust will be collected and used as drinking water onboard. Pratt says his company is already fielding questions from boat tour companies and others who are interested in either building new hydrogen-powered vessels or retrofitting their current ships. There is one more challenge, though, to achieve the goal of zero emissions. The hydrogen fuel that powers a vessel like this isn't necessarily clean. Lennie Klebanoff studies hydrogen fuel cells at Sandia National Lab. LENNIE KLEBANOFF: In the U.S., about 90% of our hydrogen is made from methane. HERSHER: When you make hydrogen from methane, the process emits some CO2. So even though the hydrogen itself is clean burning, it's not really zero emissions. There are other ways to make hydrogen, though - from biomass, for example, or - cleanest of all - from water. KLEBANOFF: So water is H2O. You get the H's off of the H2O, and you're left with O, which is oxygen. HERSHER: The hope is if even a few companies start buying hydrogen-powered ships in the coming decade, the demand for clean hydrogen will go up, and fossil fuels will stop being the go-to for global shipping.

Elias Williams for NPR hide caption Helen Harris, a former systems engineer for Dell, says her career was derailed a few years ago because of the way she looks. She was born and identifies as a woman. Helen Harris doesn't wear makeup or feminine jewelry. She mostly dresses in men's tailored suits and men's shoes. She's gender nonconforming and identifies as a woman. And, she says, that's nobody's business. Which is why in late 2015, when she started taking hormones to become more masculine looking, she did it quietly. Harris, 37, is a systems engineer who worked at Dell, selling technology to major companies and helping them set it up. But she says she had a tough time moving up at the computer company and was assigned to a lengthy training period, while colleagues were promoted. She says she got heckled by co-workers when she gave presentations. And, Harris says, one of her instructors kept telling her \"people have to like you for you to be able to do this job. He kept saying stuff like that to me.\" NPR spoke to four colleagues with whom Harris has worked. They described a talented young woman whose career was completely derailed a few years ago. And they, like Harris, suspect she had a tough time because of the way she looks. Her struggle at Dell led Harris to file a complaint with New York City's Commission on Human Rights, alleging the company didn't want to put her in front of customers because of her appearance. Dell says Harris' situation was resolved amicably. But there are at least two other cases against the company from LGBTQ workers alleging discrimination. Dell, which is an NPR sponsor, denied liability in one case. The other is ongoing. After Harris' company merged with Dell, she and other employees were assigned to training. Harris says she was heckled by co-workers when she gave presentations. She says her colleagues who attended the training started moving up the corporate ladder, but Harris didn't. Elias Williams for NPR hide caption After Harris' company merged with Dell, she and other employees were assigned to training. Harris says she was heckled by co-workers when she gave presentations. She says her colleagues who attended the training started moving up the corporate ladder, but Harris didn't. Harris says her problems happened around the same time her employer, EMC, was merging with Dell. In her complaint, Harris detailed how she kept being told she needed to keep on training. So she did \u2014 for three years. During that time, she says, she'd speak with managers, executives, colleagues and human resources. \"What is the problem? Like, if there is a problem with me, like [with] what I'm doing, can someone please speak up?\" she says she asked them. The rights of trans and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. are starting to get more attention. Activists say limited job opportunities and lack of clear protection from workplace discrimination have helped marginalize transgender people and hurt them financially. Over 200 companies \u2014 including Amazon, Google and Uber \u2014 have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that federal civil rights law prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender workers. The Justice Department has argued that it does not. 'Don't tell these people that you're transgender. It's a career ender.' Cicilia Gilbert, on what she says a trans co-worker advised her And there's this idea that the tech industry is a place where stuff like this doesn't happen: Scooter in to work and have piercings and tattoos? No problem. As long as you work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or what you look like. The diversity numbers at big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Apple tell a different story. Take Facebook: Less than a quarter of tech roles there are held by women; African Americans make up only about 1%. And when you look at Dell, you get a complicated picture. Cicilia Gilbert, who was also a systems engineer at Dell, was let go in 2018, during the middle of her transition. Maranie R. Staab for NPR hide caption Cicilia Gilbert, who was also a systems engineer at Dell, was let go in 2018, during the middle of her transition. The company has repeatedly been ranked among the 50 best for diversity. But several current and former Dell employees, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the company's New York office has the reputation of being a \"boys club.\" Cicilia Gilbert, who was also a systems engineer at Dell, says it's especially bad in the tech sales division. Gilbert, 58, is suing Dell for, among other things, allegedly discriminating against her for her gender transition. The case is ongoing. She told NPR that when she decided to transition from male to female, a trans co-worker advised her: \"Don't tell these people that you're transgender. It's a career ender.\" In her lawsuit, Gilbert said that in late 2018, right in the middle of her transition, she was let go. \"They said, 'We're laying you off because your transgender transition is impeding your ability to travel,' \" she told NPR. It's not unusual for a company as large as Dell to face discrimination lawsuits. Jennifer Davis, a spokeswoman for Dell, told NPR that Gilbert's layoff had nothing to do with her gender \u2014 it was part of a restructuring in which hundreds lost their jobs. Gilbert and her wife, Alexandra, stand in their yard in upstate New York. Gilbert is suing Dell for, among other things, allegedly discriminating against her for her gender transition. The case is ongoing. Maranie R. Staab for NPR hide caption Gilbert and her wife, Alexandra, stand in their yard in upstate New York. Gilbert is suing Dell for, among other things, allegedly discriminating against her for her gender transition. The case is ongoing. And Davis pointed to the company's support network for trans employees. NPR spoke to two workers who say the extensive medical coverage and support Dell offers made their gender transition possible. They said they consider themselves very fortunate to work for a company that's so inclusive. But in 2017, the Massachusetts attorney general investigated the case of a former intern who is trans and who had complained about discrimination. Dell denied wrongdoing but paid a $110,000 settlement. Harris says she always saw the tech industry as a place where, no matter what you look like, \"if you put your head down and you learn the stuff and you do the work, you can change your circumstances.\" Earlier this summer, Harris told NPR she was still on Dell's payroll, but she wasn't going into the office on a regular basis anymore. In her complaint to New York City's Commission on Human Rights, she detailed her problems using Dell's bathrooms. \"That's the truth,\" she told NPR. She added that after being harassed a second time about which restroom she was using, she decided to stop going to work. Harris said she was exhausted. A few weeks later, she left the company. Harris quit working at Dell but plans on staying in a career in tech. Elias Williams for NPR hide caption Harris quit working at Dell but plans on staying in a career in tech. Davis, Dell's spokeswoman, wouldn't provide details about Harris' time at the company, saying she wishes to respect Harris' privacy. But Davis said, \"The matter was resolved amicably.\" Despite her experience at Dell, Harris said she wants to keep working in the tech industry. \"I want my money. I don't want to be poor,\" she said. \"My father, he picked cotton. My grandfather was a sharecropper. I'm a systems engineer. So, I'd rather stay.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It has blueprints for a code-breaking machine on a crimson background. SHAPIRO: A complex mathematical formula in white lettering. KELLY: And on top of it all, a portrait of a well-dressed man with dark hair parted on the side. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CARNEY: It's my great pleasure to announce that the scientist that will feature on the 50-pound note is Alan Turing. (APPLAUSE) KELLY: That is Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, making the announcement. SHAPIRO: Alan Turing is probably best known for cracking the Nazi code known as Enigma, a feat depicted in the 2014 film \"The Imitation Game.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE IMITATION GAME\") BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: (As Alan Turing) I'm designing a machine that will allow us to break every message, every day, instantly. KELLY: Turing is also considered the father of modern computing. ANDREW HODGES: He had to invent the idea of the computer as the thing on which you play out the computer program. KELLY: Andrew Hodges is a mathematical physicist at the University of Oxford. He wrote a biography of Turing. HODGES: And that sounds completely crazy, but it is more or less what he did and gives a flavor of the way in which he was so far ahead of his time. SHAPIRO: Turing's work was cut short in 1952, when he was convicted of gross indecency for having a sexual relationship with another man. He chose to be chemically castrated rather than serve jail time. And his security clearance was taken away. He died two years later, widely thought to have been suicide. KELLY: Turing was cleared of that conviction in 2013, and now, fully recognized for his brilliance, he will appear on the same currency note as the queen who pardoned him. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

        "title": "Tech Firms Face Lawmakers Over Antitrust, Digital Currency : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Well, while the House is looking today at whether Google and other tech giants are too big, across Capitol Hill, senators are debating whether it would be OK if Facebook creates its own currency - safe to say Facebook has not convinced either Republicans or Democrats so far. Some lawmakers are downright hostile to the idea that a company that has broken public trust repeatedly, especially in its handling of user data, would venture into high-stakes global finance. NPR's Aarti Shahani reports on today's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Facebook has proposed with partners to create digital money, a currency called the Libra. The move requires approval by regulators who are overseen by lawmakers who were on fire at today's hearing and using fire metaphors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHERROD BROWN: Facebook is dangerous. SHAHANI: Senator Sherrod Brown, Ohio Democrat... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BROWN: Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience. SHAHANI: Money is a massive experiment in trust. We trust the dollar. We use it and don't burn it because we trust that it's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Facebook does not have a great track record in trust, as David Marcus, the man at the company who oversees the new currency project, admitted repeatedly as he sat in the hot seat. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID MARCUS: Trust is primordial, and we've made mistakes in the past. And we have been working and are continuing to work really hard to get better. SHAHANI: Primordial, meaning from the beginning of time. The endearing origin story of Facebook, the miracle of capitalism - started in a college dorm - was absent. Senators offered an alternative origin story that early on, Facebook killed the local newspapers that keep those with power accountable; that by making hate speech go viral, it helped fuel genocide in the country Myanmar; that Facebook turned a blind eye to Russian interference in the 2016 elections; that the company has lied repeatedly about how it handles users' personal data. Senator Martha McSally, Arizona Republican... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTHA MCSALLY: Mr. Marcus, I don't trust Facebook, and it's because of the repeated violations of your users' privacy, repeated deceit. And I am not alone. SHAHANI: Facebook's Marcus promised that if given permission to mint money, the company would monitor and report money laundering, but Facebook would not exploit users' spending data to target ads though Facebook has said one thing and done another before. The company promised to keep customer data private. Then, charged with lying, it entered a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. And now caught up again, Facebook faces a $5 billion fine. Marcus made this case. Digital currency is not a data grab. Rather, it will make Facebook more popular by making it a shopping destination kind of like Amazon. As he tried to explain to Senator McSally, that is a service to an estimated 90 million businesses on Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARCUS: If they now have the ability to sell to more constituents across the Facebook platform and more people have access to the services and products of those 90 million businesses, then more commerce will happen on the Facebook platform. MCSALLY: Oh, that's wonderful public good that you guys are committed to. I know I'm way over time here, and that was extremely sarcastic. Thank you. SHAHANI: Timing matters. The announcement by Facebook that it plans to create its own currency may be too soon after Wall Street's financial crisis or too soon after Facebook's data scandals, which are still ongoing. Though Senator Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Republican, did offer some encouragement for the tech giant's foray into digital currency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAT TOOMEY: To announce in advance that we have to strangle this baby in the crib I think is wildly premature. SHAHANI: Tomorrow Facebook's Marcus appears before the House Financial Services Committee. This is one of a handful of hearings this week examining the power of big tech. Aarti Shahani, NPR News.

        "texts": "Aarti Shahani Avie Schneider U.S. lawmakers will question lobbyists and officials from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple on an array of issues. Reuters hide caption U.S. lawmakers will question lobbyists and officials from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple on an array of issues. Updated at 1:25 p.m. ET Given Facebook's track record of broken promises over privacy, U.S. senators said Tuesday that the social media giant can't be trusted when it comes to plans to launch a digital currency. \"Facebook is dangerous,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"Like a toddler who's gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience.\" Brown said Facebook has helped destroy local news outlets. \"This kind of creative disruption that doesn't actually create anything is just disruption,\" he said. Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple officials are testifying Tuesday at three separate congressional hearings on an array of issues, including whether they're so big they stifle competition. The hearings reflect a new mood in Washington, where lawmakers, regulators and even President Trump are calling for more thorough reviews of the big tech companies, with a goal of tougher regulation to level the playing field. The head of Facebook's effort to create a new digital currency called Libra told the Senate Banking Committee that the company wants to work closely with policymakers and regulators. Those setting up Libra expect it to be \"licensed, regulated, and subject to supervisory oversight,\" said David Marcus, who heads Calibra, Facebook's digital currency project. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., cited Facebook's repeated violations of its users' privacy. \"I don't trust you guys,\" she said. \"So instead of cleaning up your house, now you're launching into another business model with Calibra here.\" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said it was too soon to dismiss Facebook's Libra plan. \"I just think we should be exploring this. ... To announce in advance that we have to strangle this baby, I think, is wildly premature.\" Marcus acknowledged Facebook's missteps. \"Trust is primordial, and we've made mistakes in the past,\" he said. \"And we have been working and are continuing to work really hard to get better.\" Because Facebook is launching Libra with 100 partners, \"you will not have to trust Facebook,\" Marcus said. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made it clear at a briefing on Monday that he's not ready to support Facebook's currency plan \u2014 at least not yet. \"I'm not going to publicly speculate how long I think it will take them to get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" he said. \"But they are a long way away.\" Later on Tuesday, lobbyists for Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook are scheduled to go before a House Judiciary subcommittee. Lawmakers there are expected to question the companies about how they dominate markets, making it difficult for other companies to be competitive or have access to advertising, app creation and media. Also Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee will ask a Google lobbyist about whether the company's search engine ranks posts by conservative media and bloggers lower than other kinds of search results. Trump and other conservatives have been alleging the big tech companies have anti-conservative bias. The tech giants have denied bias and studies have no found evidence of it. Facebook has faced increasing scrutiny over privacy violations. The Federal Trade Commission reportedly voted recently to fine the social media giant about $5 billion to settle a case stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm, which worked on President Trump's 2016 campaign, acquired the personal data of millions of Facebook users.

        "texts": "Scott Neuman American aerospace engineer John Houbolt as he stands at a chalkboard in July 1962 showing his lunar orbit rendezvous plan for landing astronauts on the moon. NASA/LARC/Bob Nye/PhotoQuest/Getty Images hide caption American aerospace engineer John Houbolt as he stands at a chalkboard in July 1962 showing his lunar orbit rendezvous plan for landing astronauts on the moon. The Apollo program conjures images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon and the massive team effort involved in getting him there. But a fundamental decision that led to the successful lunar landings came largely as a result of one man's determination to buck the system at NASA. That man was John C. Houbolt. Houbolt's vision of how to get to the moon prevailed over ideas pushed by NASA's heaviest hitters, including the German-born rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who designed the Saturn V, and Max Faget, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from British Honduras who was responsible for the Mercury capsule that put the first Americans into space. In April 1961, President John F. Kennedy had energized America's space program by pledging to send \"a man to the moon and [return] him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the 1960s. But at NASA, a fundamental question first had to be answered: What was the exact mode for getting to the moon? Without knowing that, it was impossible to even begin designing the machines to go there. In the late 1950s, before America had even put a man into space, NASA was already thinking about what it would take to put astronauts on the moon. But there was no broad agreement. Three main camps, which quickly grew into factions, backed different solutions. Direct ascent A heated behind-the-scenes debate ensued, with many of the space agency's engineers drawn to what seemed like the most obvious approach \u2014 a plan known as direct ascent. An early NASA concept for a lunar landing using the direct ascent method. NASA hide caption Think pre-Apollo concepts of space travel: a rocket launches from Earth, shoots directly to the moon and then lands, carrying with it all the fuel and supplies needed to get there and back home. \"Most people wanted to just build a big rocket and stack it up and send it all to the moon,\" says Roger Launius, a former NASA chief historian and senior curator at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. But direct ascent required an enormous vehicle to make the lunar landing, something that might have been 50 feet or more in height and extremely precarious to land. A huge new rocket, the Nova \u2014 even bigger than the already titanic Saturn V \u2014 would be needed just to lift such a beast into Earth orbit. The Nova was still on the drawing board, and even von Braun had his doubts about its feasibility and how quickly it could be ready to fly. NASA illustration comparing configurations of what would become the Saturn 1B and the Saturn V with an even larger rocket, the Nova, which was never developed. NASA hide caption NASA illustration comparing configurations of what would become the Saturn 1B and the Saturn V with an even larger rocket, the Nova, which was never developed. The bottom line, according to Launius: \"There was no way to do [direct ascent] within the time frame that Kennedy had set for the landing.\" Earth orbit rendezvous A second camp, led by von Braun, liked another option \u2014 something called Earth orbit rendezvous, or EOR. It was essentially a variation on the direct ascent theme. EOR involved the same giant vehicle to go to the moon and required two or more Saturn Vs to launch the pieces into Earth orbit, where astronauts would assemble them, using a space station as a base of operations. EOR \"enjoyed strong support inside of NASA,\" according to a fact sheet put out by NASA in 1992, \"especially among those who recognized that [its] selection ... would require the virtual construction of a space station, a platform in Earth orbit that could have many other uses, scientific and otherwise, beyond Apollo.\" Von Braun had long dreamed of a space station, and as the debate grew louder, he held tenaciously to EOR, Launius says. Credit: NASA Lunar orbit rendezvous There was also a third way \u2014 a dark horse candidate favored by a minority of engineers led by Houbolt at NASA's Langley Research Center. Lunar orbit rendezvous, or LOR, would require only one Saturn V and two smaller vehicles to go to the moon \u2014 a mother ship to stay in lunar orbit, which came to be known as the command module, while a lightweight lunar module, designed solely to land and return from the lunar surface, made the descent. The catch? Astronauts, circling the moon nearly a quarter of a million miles away from any possibility of rescue, would have to link up the two spaceships to get home. To the NASA establishment, that sounded way too risky. Nearly all but Houbolt and his group of supporters at Langley dismissed it out of hand. At the time, no one had ever done rendezvous or docking in space \u2014 maneuvers that are considered the bread and butter of spaceflight today but that were daunting and untried concepts in the early 1960s. \"If rendezvous had to be part of Project Apollo, critics of LOR felt that it should be done only in Earth orbit,\" according to the NASA fact sheet. In case the maneuver was unsuccessful, the astronauts could easily return home. However, \"if a rendezvous around the moon failed, the astronauts would be too far away to be saved. Nothing could be done,\" it said. An illustration attributed to John Houbolt describing the lunar orbit rendezvous method. NASA hide caption Houbolt believed the risks of LOR were manageable. And further, he was adamant that a rendezvous of two spacecraft in lunar orbit wasn't just one possible method for a moon mission, but the only one that had any chance of meeting Kennedy's nearly impossible deadline. To Houbolt, it was a simple equation involving the need to save weight, time and money. Lunar orbit rendezvous accomplished all three. But despite the obvious advantages, Houbolt faced an uphill battle. \"He got batted down by pretty much everybody,\" Launius says. There was von Braun's opposition, but also vehement pushback from Faget, the Mercury capsule designer. In one meeting attended by NASA Associate Administrator Robert Seamans, von Braun and Faget, Houbolt pitched LOR. After the presentation, Faget rose from his seat to denounce Houbolt's plan. \"His figures lie!\" Faget proclaimed. Amid a stunned silence in the room, Faget added, \"He doesn't know what he's talking about!\" The outsider gets a hearing His idea for getting to the moon may have been roundabout, but Houbolt himself was direct. He was also an outsider among the group of engineers studying a moonshot. \"Houbolt was not part of the program, and that is really where a core issue comes into play,\" Launius says. \"He went to his boss and his boss sort of shouted him down and said, 'What are you doing?' because he wasn't working in this area at all.\" Frustrated with his inability to get anyone to listen, in November 1961, Houbolt wrote a letter to Seamans, essentially going straight to the top of the NASA hierarchy. The move was a breach of protocol that Houbolt acknowledged in the letter was \"somewhat unorthodox.\" But, he insisted, \"[the] issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted.\" \"Do we want to go to the moon or not?\" Houbolt asked rhetorically, challenging the administrator to act. \"Why is Nova, with its ponderous size, simply just accepted, and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive?\" The letter got Seamans' attention. \"It was rather strident in the way it was written,\" the former NASA official recalled in a 2008 documentary. \"My first reaction was, 'I'd like some way to get that son of a gun off my back.' \" In a reply to Houbolt, Seamans promised to put LOR into active consideration. Months later, at a June 1962 meeting, von Braun unexpectedly reversed course and publicly announced that he was recommending lunar orbit rendezvous. Despite their differences, Houbolt \u2014 who left the space agency in 1963 \u2014 was invited by von Braun to mission control in Houston to witness the historic Apollo 11 landing on July 20, 1969. Amid the exuberance and celebration in the room after the Eagle reported touchdown on the moon's Sea of Tranquility, \"a wonderful thing happened,\" Houbolt, who died in 2014, said years later. \"Von Braun turned to me ... and says, 'Thank you, John. It is a good idea.' \" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

        "texts": "GUY RAZ, HOST: Hello, Doug. DOUG ROBLE: Hello. RAZ: Hello, Doug. It's Guy Raz here. How are you? ROBLE: Very good. How are you? RAZ: Good. I am talking to the real Doug, right? This is real Doug, not digital Doug? ROBLE: You know, before I started this, I did not realize how often I would be asked that question. RAZ: (Laughter). ROBLE: It's quite annoying at work - people keep poking me to make sure that I'm actually there. RAZ: This is Doug Roble, and Doug makes digital humans that look exactly like us. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ROBLE: I'm not a real person. I'm actually a copy of a real person. Although, I feel like a real person. It's kind of hard to explain. Hold on - I think I saw a real person - there's one. Let's bring him onstage. RAZ: OK, so obviously, Doug, this is your voice on the TED stage. But because we're on the radio and not on TV, can you explain what's going on here? ROBLE: Well, first of all, I'm wearing a motion capture suit. Then I'm also wearing a - basically, a bicycle helmet that has a camera and some lights attached to it. And the reason I'm wearing that is because I'm controlling a digital version of me at the same time that I'm out on stage. RAZ: Yeah, there's a giant screen, and we're just seeing you on the screen. But it's a version of you made up of ones and zeros. ROBLE: It is. It's - I'm basically controlling a computer game character. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ROBLE: What you see up there is a digital human. We call him DigiDoug. He's actually a 3D character that I'm controlling live, in real time. RAZ: And Doug makes more than just digital versions of himself. For nearly three decades, he's worked on creating digital effects and digital humans for the film industry. ROBLE: The next step would be to do an entire film where one character is just a computer-generated character who you just don't even realize is computer-generated. RAZ: At that point, the possibilities are presumably - are endless, right? You could have that character do whatever you want it to do. ROBLE: Yeah. I mean, it opens up a lot of doors. It could be really cool. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Doug Roble and DigiDoug continue this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ROBLE: We've been putting humans and creatures into film that you accept as real. If they're happy, you should feel happy. And if they feel pain, you should empathize with them. If you were having a conversation with DigiDoug, one on one, is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you? So that was our goal. But why did we do this? First of all, it is just crazy cool. (LAUGHTER) ROBLE: How cool is it? Well, with the push of a button, I can deliver this talk as a completely different character. (LAUGHTER) ROBLE: This is Elbor. We put him together to test how this would work with a different appearance, right? And the cool thing about this technology is that, while I've changed my character, the performance is still all me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Right in the middle of your talk - so we're still seeing Digital Doug on the screen - you push a button, and then Digital Doug turns into a character named Elbor... ROBLE: (Laughter). RAZ: ...Who sort of looks like an elf or a troll. But he's mimicking - he's still you. Like, every turn of your head or microexpression - like, Elbor is mimicking that. You become Elbor. ROBLE: Yes. We wanted to see how far we could push this technology. So here, we're taking my motion. And I'm over 6 foot tall. And we're transferring it on to this guy who's, I think, about 3-foot-6. So he's about half my size. It's just like, oh, look. I'm a little critter. And you talk about inhabiting a character. I really inhabited that character. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, every teeny movement of your mouth, of your face, like, Elbor was doing the same thing. And it was at that point in your talk where I freaked out - and not in a good way, Doug. I saw that, and I thought, this is going to be used in a really scary way. Right then at that point when I saw you turn into Elbor, I thought, wow, we can inhabit anybody. We will be able to inhabit anyone and pretend like we are them. ROBLE: We are entirely aware of this. This is one of the big things with this technology - is that it presents so many neat opportunities. But at the exact same time, if we created a digital double of somebody who was famous and I put on the suit and then all of a sudden, I can control that famous person with my body and my face, that gets really, really creepy. And it gets really tricky. The one thing that's nice is to get a character of this quality right now, the barrier's extraordinarily high. When you say you were flabbergasted by it, when I see it, all I see are the flaws. And so there's still a level of reality that we want to push it towards. RAZ: I mean, it's clear that we are heading there, that it will get perfect pretty soon. And at some point, the barrier will actually be pretty low to sort of getting into this. When I was a kid, there was a film that freaked me out. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE RUNNING MAN\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) In the year 2017... RAZ: It's called \"The Running Man.\" And it was implausible. It was based around a prison. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE RUNNING MAN\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) It's a game between life and death. RAZ: And Arnold Schwarzenegger was a prisoner in the Running Man. And, you know, the object was to escape being hunted down and then, you know, killed. ROBLE: Yep. RAZ: He was in this prison because he was framed for committing a massacre. And they made a fake video that showed him killing people. And when I was a kid, and you watched it, you thought, that's just implausible. How could you ever do that? And when I was watching your TED Talk, I had a flashback to that movie... ROBLE: Yeah. RAZ: ...Because as absurd as it was in the '80s or in the '90s, it's actually happening. We've already seen politicians' videos being manipulated. We just saw it not too long ago with the speaker of the House. ROBLE: And that was an easy manipulation. And even if you did have a super good way of detecting these things, it's going to take time. And especially with the Internet now and everything, if a video like that goes out and it has a day or two to run around the world unmolested, if you come out later and say, oh, no, that was a fake video, people have moved on already. And they've - the damage is done. It's - hopefully, people have this nice dose of skepticism whenever they look at something and say, where's the source? Is this really what happened? I think that's key 'cause it's going to be really, really hard to stop. RAZ: That's Doug Roble. He's a computer graphics researcher with Digital Domain. You can see Doug's full talk at ted.com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DIGITAL WITNESS\") ST VINCENT: (Singing) Digital witnesses. What's the point of even sleeping? If I can't show it, if you can't see me, what's the point of doing anything?

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear our voice. Shay (ph) had that realization as a child helping out at the family business, a deli in south West Virginia. SHAY: We did a lot of business with the deli, a lot of call-in orders, and I had to answer the phone with the name of the business. VEDANTAM: Often when the phone rang, the same thing happened over and over again. SHAY: I vividly remember always being confused for my mother. They would always say, hey Judy (ph), you know, and either start into their questions or whatever they were looking to speak to my mother about. VEDANTAM: This case of mistaken identity became a running joke. SHAY: You know, it was ha-ha, they thought that he was Judy. VEDANTAM: Shay didn't correct the callers. That's because Shay didn't mind being mistaken for Judy. SHAY: It was just comforting to me because it felt natural. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Shay was raised as a boy. But now, decades later, Shay identifies as a transgender woman. We're not using her legal name at her request because it's a man's name. Shay's experience at the deli became a template for the rest of her life. She listened to her voice, and she listened to the way others heard her voice. There was always a gap between the two. She first tried to sound more masculine to fit in with the way the world saw her. SHAY: So I would consciously make an effort to try to talk a little deeper. It was - you know, I practiced it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\") THE DOORS: (Singing) And I woke up in morning, I got myself a beer. VEDANTAM: One way she practiced was to sing along with The Doors, Tool and Nine Inch Nails. SHAY: I tended to sort of go towards heavier music. You know, raspy, deep - yelling, almost - voices. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ROADHOUSE BLUES\") THE DOORS: (Singing) Let it roll all night long. VEDANTAM: Sounding more masculine became second nature. But it wore on her. SHAY: My entire life, I have been playing the role of a boy. And it is exhausting. It truly is. VEDANTAM: Years and years passed like this. A divorce, a second wife, two kids and a cancer scare later, Shay began to reconsider how she wanted to sound. Instead of trying to sound more masculine, she now started to try to sound more feminine. SHAY: Even prior to accepting that I was trans before I could put a label on what I was, I consciously made an effort to not sound as masculine, and that started in my early 30s. VEDANTAM: Once again, she used music as a way to practice. (SOUNDBITE OF BRITNEY SPEARS SONG, \"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\") SHAY: I would always sing in the car alone. And I would attempt Britney Spears. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\") BRITNEY SPEARS: (Singing) I think I did it again. I made you believe we're more than just friends. Baby. SHAY: It seems silly, but I would, when I'm singing in the car, I would sort of turn my head towards my driver's side window... (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) 'Cause to lose all my senses. SHAY: ...Because it would reflect the sound back to me a little more loudly so that I could hear the pitch and tone of my voice. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) Oops. I did it again. I played with your heart. SHAY: And I would try to make my voice sound at a higher pitch without it sounding like I was trying. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\") SPEARS: (Singing) Love, and I'm sent from above. I'm not that innocent. VEDANTAM: What did you hear? Did you hear the voice that you wanted to hear? SHAY: No. No. I've never - I don't know that I have ever actually been able to hear the same voice that I hear come from me. VEDANTAM: Shay has spent a lifetime being dissatisfied with the way she sounds. She viscerally knows something the rest of us often forget - our voices shape who we are. They shape how other people think of us. (SOUNDBITE OF CROSSTALK) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. RUPAL PATEL: Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Plus how technology might help people with vocal impairments find voices that reflect who they are... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LONNIE BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. VEDANTAM: ...And the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really, anything. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jackie Kirk (ph) used to love the sound of her voice. She spent her 20s in San Francisco. And like many young people living in the big city, she enjoyed going out with her friends. She danced to electronic music at clubs and drank at bars. She was outgoing, and she was a flirt. JACKIE KIRK: I have to admit I've always enjoyed flirting. (Laughter). And so I was quite the flirter. (Laughter). It was sort of a fun activity to help pass the day - you know, doing something mundane, you know, at work. VEDANTAM: For Jackie, flirting was also a demonstration of her confidence. KIRK: It reinforces my own identity, how I felt about myself - fun, I'm somebody that people are attracted to, not just physically or sexually, but a person who people like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jackie liked to be liked. She liked being someone people wanted to be around. When she thinks about who she was back then she refers to that person as Voice One Jackie. KIRK: Voice One Jackie (laughter) was really fun-loving, always joking, pretty carefree. VEDANTAM: For years, Jackie had been doing backpacking trips with her then-boyfriend. KIRK: All of our gear on our back. Fifty pounds, 60 pounds, et cetera. Even carrying bottles of wine, (laughter), you know, in the backpack. VEDANTAM: She'd been doing these backpacking trips for several years. But during a trip to a national forest in California, Jackie came up short. KIRK: I couldn't go one step further. I - you know, and being young, you think, you know, what could it be? There's nothing wrong with me. I'm 20, whatever, 20-something years old. And I notice I'm getting really short of breath, and it was a real struggle. Yeah. I finally made it, of course, but it was really slow and a real struggle to make it back. VEDANTAM: Hiking became too taxing for her so she cut back and switched to ballet. But one day during a series of releves, a more aerobically challenging dance move, Jackie felt lightheaded and dizzy. It was serious. KIRK: I had a seizure. And, you know, all of the medical follow-up led me to discover that I had a lung disease. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: She was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. It's a rare, progressive disease where the blood vessels in the lungs shrink and oxygen is not distributed properly. KIRK: There's no cure for it except for a lung transplant. VEDANTAM: In 2008, at 32, Jackie received a double lung transplant. The surgery was successful. Within weeks, she was out of the hospital and back in the dance studio. In 2010, she left San Francisco to explore Latin America and Europe, but her body began to reject her new lungs. Before long, Jackie was back in the hospital, this time in Switzerland, waiting for another lung transplant. KIRK: I had the surgery in January of 2013, and I was asleep still for another month and a half. VEDANTAM: When she woke up, she found her surgery had been successful, except for one very important thing. KIRK: I couldn't speak. I couldn't speak. VEDANTAM: During the operation, the medical staff had used a ventilator to help her breathe. KIRK: So I was intubated. That means they basically have a tube that they put inside your mouth, and it goes down your throat. And they send that down into your lungs. And during this intubation, the tube was rigid enough to cause some damage to my vocal cords. VEDANTAM: Jackie began speech therapy, and within a few weeks she slowly regained the ability to speak. But the voice that came out of her mouth, it wasn't her voice. KIRK: My voice changed. Its raspier. It's broken a bit. VEDANTAM: Ever since, speaking has been hard work. KIRK: Yeah. I really have to push my - I feel it. It's actually a physical effort. Like, I'm actually squeezing the vocal cords as hard as I can to make the loudest sound possible to get to be heard. (Laughter). And it's very tiring. VEDANTAM: The harder it became to produce sound, the more self-conscious she became about the way she sounded. KIRK: I feel less confident. I'm aware of how people might perceive me. So I'm a little more shy. I don't approach people like I used to. VEDANTAM: Jackie believes the change in her voice has led to a dramatic change in her personality. For much of her life, her voice was a manifestation of her confidence. KIRK: I used to go to clubs quite a bit, you know? But, you know, when you have a normal voice, you can still talk to people in those environments where it's kind of loud and noisy, or bars to meet friends or to flirt, (laughter), like I like doing. But, you know, those places now, you know, I don't really go to anymore. VEDANTAM: Jackie, a woman who once described herself as carefree and outgoing who took pride in her ability to flirt, became withdrawn, reserved. KIRK: You know, I have tons of scars all over my body, and that plays on my confidence as well. But in public life, people can't see those scars. And I feel like my voice is that, you know, that scar they can hear, you know? They know something's wrong and that they know, oh, maybe she's weak, maybe she's sick, just by hearing my voice. It's this signal. VEDANTAM: Our voices communicate so much more than mere information. They communicate our feelings, our temperament, our identity. When we come back - how scientists are weaving this insight into custom-built voices. MAEVE FLACK: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Scientists have been trying for more than two centuries to analyze the human voice, decode its components and recreate it. An early success came from a man named Homer Dudley. He developed an organ-like machine that he called the voder. It worked using special keys and a foot pedal and was capable of creating about 20 different electronic buzzes and sounds. When those sounds were combined, they formed words. The voder fascinated people at the 1939 World's Fair in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, we've heard the voder make a word. And by combining words, of course, we got a sentence. For example, Helen, will you have the voder say, she saw me? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That sounded awfully flat. How about a little expression? Say the sentence in answer to these questions. Who saw you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Whom did she see? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, did she see you or hear you? VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. VEDANTAM: The voder was an early example of electronic speech, but it was cumbersome to operate and required special training. Over the next 40 years, speech scientists continued studying the components of the human voice. They eventually developed methods to mathematically map the acoustic patterns and phonetic properties of natural speech - vowels, syllable constructions, consonants. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Welcome to the Stockholm speech communication seminar. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #3: Hello, I (unintelligible) machine. Welcome to Mid-Manhattan Library. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) A, B, C, D, E, F, G... COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #5: To be or not to be, that is the question. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #6: I can read stories and speak them aloud. I do not understand what the words mean when I read them. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #7: This is such a beautiful (unintelligible). You are listening to the voice of a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #4: (Singing) When we know our ABC's. VEDANTAM: By the '80s, speech synthesis was no longer the stuff of science demonstrations at shows and fairs. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #8: Text-to-speech systems are beginning to be applied in many ways, including aids for the handicapped, medical aids and teaching devices. The first kind of aid to be considered as a talking aid for the vocally handicapped. VEDANTAM: The research of Dennis Klatt at MIT paved the way for the voices we might be familiar with today, many of them used in assistive communication devices. BETTY: I am beautiful Betty, the standard female voice. HARRY: I am huge Harry, a very large person with a deep voice. PAUL: I am the standard male voice, perfect Paul. VEDANTAM: This last one, by the way, became famous after Stephen Hawking adopted it. Speech technology has come a long way in the years since Homer Dudley unveiled the voder, but in many ways, synthetic voices still sounded synthetic. They didn't convey all the information that's packed into the human voice. PATEL: Voice is identity, right? Voice is about who you are. Our voice signals how old we are. Our voice signals our gender. Our voice signals, you know, things about our personality. VEDANTAM: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. Perhaps more than many people, she has thought a lot about the human voice. When she misses her mother, for instance, Rupal has a special technique to evoke her presence. PATEL: That's right. My parents now live in LA and I live here in Boston. And oftentimes, I find myself imitating my mom. You know, I'll say, oh, beti (ph) how are you today, you know, or something like that. I'll imitate her the way she might say something. I might say that the same way to my daughter or something like that. But I - what I'm evoking is my mother's voice, primarily, to feel the closeness of her here. VEDANTAM: In 2002, Rupal took these ideas with her to Denmark where she was scheduled to speak at a conference for researchers and patients. PATEL: I was presenting some of my early work showing that individuals with very severe speech disorder still have the ability to make sound, and those sounds have some communicative content in them, some information that could be used. VEDANTAM: After her presentation, she walked out to the exhibit hall, and that's where she noticed something. Lots of people were using devices that produced synthetic voices. What was odd was that many of the voices didn't seem to match the people using them. PATEL: And at that point back in 2002, we had very limited synthetic voice of options available. And so, you - I heard a little girl, or a young girl, using a device to talk with an adult male voice and and having a conversation with another person, a middle-aged man, who also was using the same voice. And so they're using different devices, but their voices were identical. VEDANTAM: She had just presented on the idea that our individual voices carry something unique about us. So why was this not reflected in these synthetic voices? PATEL: Why are we giving them the same black box to speak through? There's got to be something that we can do that we can harness the quality of the voices that they have and imprint those or use that to give them a prosthetic voice that somehow reflects who they are and not just the same voice for everyone. VEDANTAM: Could a synthetic voice capture the richness of natural human speech? Rupal launched a company to answer this question. It's called VocaliD, and it uses machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to create personalized voices. PATEL: So what synthetic speech is is taking recordings of anyone and then taking those recordings and building a model of the voice quality of the annunciation abilities, right? You aren't necessarily analyzing it from a top down, saying, well, this person has a high-pitched voice or this person has a low-pitched voice. You're taking the recordings as basically the raw ingredients to feed to a machine-learning algorithm or set of algorithms, really. And those are - they're learning the patterns of the clarity of the person's S, the - you know, how that sound is changed in the different phonetic environments, the voice qualities aspects of - you know, all of these are learned by the machine. It's really re-emulating the human voice by a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In other words, the idea is to build a model of how a person sounds. To do so, you use a vast range of examples of that person's speech. Then you use the model to produce spoken language that incorporates all the idiosyncrasies and texture of that person's voice. One of Rupal's early clients was a young girl, Maeve Flack. PATEL: Maeve was born with cerebral palsy. She's in a beautiful family where she has two other older sisters. VEDANTAM: Rupal's goal was to give Maeve her own unique synthetic voice, one that could express not just her words but her identity. The first step was to record her. MAEVE: (Unintelligible) (Laughter). PATEL: So those sounds were the kinds of sounds that are unique to Maeve. Those are the sounds that she makes where if - you know, when she's in a classroom with several other kids who also have communication disabilities, when she makes that sound, you know it's Maeve speaking. So we harnessed those sounds of Maeve's to create her unique voice for her. VEDANTAM: Then Rupal turned to Maeve's older sisters, Erin and Meghan, who volunteered to record their voices so they could be blended with Maeve's. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ice cream is my guilty pleasure. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That man ran fast. VEDANTAM: Erin and Meghan read hundreds of sentences and phrases and uploaded them to a website for Rupal. Like a painter mixing a palette, Rupal took elements of Maeve's voice and mixed them with those of her sisters and other vocal donors to create what she calls a bespoke voice. MAEVE: I can't wait for my friends to hear my new voice. My parents are really happy I'm not addicted to Fortnite. I want to meet Taylor Swift. PATEL: So we're hearing, you know, Maeve at this age in terms of her sound as well as her siblings' recordings being combined and being produced through this speech synthesis engine. VEDANTAM: It's possible that Maeve may decide as she gets older that her voice needs to age with her. She'll need a new bespoke voice at that point. The same technology can also be used to preserve a person's existing voice. Sometimes this is done when a person faces the prospect of losing his voice. PATEL: These could be individuals who are losing their voice to degenerative conditions - so slowly their voice is changing - such as ALS or Parkinson's disease and then those who the trauma is actually far more pronounced for individuals with something like head and neck cancer where they learn that they're going to have their voice box removed within a couple of weeks. VEDANTAM: Lonnie Blanchard confronted this traumatic news in 2018. Doctors had diagnosed him with cancer and said surgery was the only option. Lonnie had to have his tongue removed. Here he is speaking to the BBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: Now that I know I'm going to lose my voice, I got to get some things down on a personal recorder to get what I would normally say to my wife and kids. But every time I go to do that, I draw a blank. VEDANTAM: By the time Lonnie started working with Rupal, he only had a few weeks to back his voice. PATEL: We helped him get set up in terms of the microphone he would need, and things like that. VEDANTAM: Rupal walked with Lonnie to build a database of sound samples before his surgery. He recorded sentences that gave Rupal and her colleagues the different kinds of sounds they would need to build a new voice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: I wish we could get acquainted. I'm going to be a teacher when I grow up. VEDANTAM: After Lonnie banked his voice, Rupal use the recordings to create a personalized voice for him. The difference between his voice and Maeve's voice is that Rupal didn't need to blend voices from donors. Lonnie was his own donor. PATEL: Those voice samples then are used, are cleaned up and annotated by machine, actually, and then used to feed into the algorithms we have to create the synthetic voice. VEDANTAM: Similar to Maeve, Lonnie uses an assistive device - in his case, an iPad. He can type out what he wants to say and hear his voice speaking to his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLANCHARD: Once you close your eyes and let your mind relax, it doesn't take long to escape to the beautiful beach. PATEL: It's really empowering. It's continued to be a way that he can connect to family members and feel that part of him is not fully lost. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: While most of us will never have the experience of losing our voices and having to obtain synthetic voices as replacements, increasingly, many of us are coming into contact with these voices. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: How many ounces are in a cup? ALEXA: One cup is 8 eight fluid ounces. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: OK, Google. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hey, Siri. Set a timer. SIRI: For how long? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Fifty-six minutes. SIRI: OK. ALEXA: Sure. SIRI: Fifty-six minutes, starting now. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Alexa? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Hey, Google? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Can you play music? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Play some jazz. SIRI: Here's a station you might like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Synthetic voices are already changing our lives, and it's likely we're going to become even more reliant on them. In May 2018, Google revealed a new program it was working on. CEO Sundar Pichai presented it to an audience of software developers. The technology is called Google Duplex. It allows you to make a restaurant reservation through a voice assistant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: How may I help you? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Hi. I'd like to reserve a table for Wednesday the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For seven people? GOOGLE DUPLEX: It's for four people. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Four people? When? Today? Tonight? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Wednesday at 6 p.m. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Actually, we reserve for upwards five people. For four people, you can come. GOOGLE DUPLEX: How long is the wait, usually, to be seated? UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: For when? Tomorrow, or a weekday, or... GOOGLE DUPLEX: For next Wednesday, the 7. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: No. It's not too busy. You can come for four people. OK? GOOGLE DUPLEX: Oh - I gotcha. Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED RESTAURANT HOST: Bye-bye. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: The audience is laughing and applauding because the man making the call isn't a man but a machine. PATEL: It didn't seem like it was a robotic voice. The robotic voices we're used to are the voices like when you are in a parking garage and you hear the, you know, please place your ticket with the stripe facing to the right - very, very canned sort of speech. This was far more sophisticated and much more like you and I talk, with hesitations and pauses, and ums and ahs. You think it's a human on the other end. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, one of the things about that voice that Google had is that it did seem like a convincing voice, but if you need to convince me that that voice is not just a human voice but a particular human's voice, you need to convince me now this is not just anyone calling for a restaurant reservation, but it's Barack Obama calling for a restaurant reservation. Presumably, now the bar is much, much higher. PATEL: That's right. It is. Barack Obama, though, does have a ton on his audio, (laughter), on the Internet. And there's a lot more audio to make, you know, his voice than there is my voice, for example. And so yeah. But it's absolutely possible to learn. And if you have long enough, you can learn anybody's voice. And if you have enough data. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It's not hard to see how bad actors could misuse this, create havoc in people's lives, trouble at companies, political misinformation. PATEL: That's absolutely - I mean, we're seeing deep fakes in video. We've seen, you know, President Obama's face with - being manipulated and the audio coming out. You know, people creating these fake media in video, and you're also seeing it audio. That's exactly why the security aspects of what we're doing are trying to detect is that fake audio, or is that real? Is part of that fake audio or is part of that real, right? So it is - this isn't completely sci fi. It isn't so far away. It isn't necessarily 20 - you know, 2028. It's probably 2020. So we've got to get our defenses up in terms of questioning where that - the authenticity of audio just as we do video. VEDANTAM: In 2017, a Canadian company called Lyrebird showed how audio deepfakes might work in politics. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. They can make us say anything now - really anything. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #9: (As Barack Obama) The good news is that they will offer the technology to anyone. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Donald Trump) This is huge. How does their technology work? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #10: (As Hillary Clinton) Hey, guys, I think that they use deep learning and artificial neural networks. VEDANTAM: By 2019, deepfake audio technology had gotten even better. Shortly after critics panned the final season of \"Game Of Thrones,\" a YouTube channel called Eating Things With Famous People put out this tongue-in-cheek video showing the supposed remorse of the lead character, Jon Snow. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"BREAKING: JON SNOW FINALLY APOLOGIZED FOR SEASON 8\") COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #11: (As Jon Snow) It's time for some apologies. I'm sorry we wasted your time. I'm sorry we didn't learn anything from the ending of \"Lost.\" I have more lines in this video than I had in the last season. I'm sorry we wrote this in, like, six days or something. Now, let us burn the script of Season 8 and just forget it forever. VEDANTAM: Spoofing a TV show is one thing, but imagine such high-quality deepfakes occurring in a more high-stakes setting. Voices are increasingly being used by financial institutions to authenticate the identities of consumers. Recently, Rupal worked with a bank to assess how vulnerable it was to vocal hacking. PATEL: We tested their authentication system by creating synthetic samples or synthetic voices of particular individuals who are enrolled in their authentication system. And we tried to test those voices against the system to see if we could get through with the synthetic voices. And we were not able to do that for every single voice, but we were able to do it for some voices. And so it just starts to show that there is a vulnerability in this technology. VEDANTAM: So how would you guard against it? PATEL: Well, there are many ways to guard against it. One is you can classify the difference between is the audio signal I'm listening to - is it synthetic or is it human? As the synthetic voices become better and better sounding, that will be a more difficult decision to make. And it is something that if we can proactively solve, I think - or at least start to address - we're going to be way ahead of the curve than if we're trying to clean up our mess after the fact. VEDANTAM: Despite the potential risks of these new technologies, Rupal is also optimistic. Voice synthesis tools have the potential to allow people to craft the voice they hear on the outside so that it matches the identity they feel on the inside. PATEL: Ideally, in the future, these decisions are made by the end user themselves. Like, oh, I actually want that to be - sound a little breathier. I'd love that to sound a little bit more confident. And, I mean, how does that translate to the acoustics? We don't quite know yet, but that's actually I think where - when we can finally give the control of what the voice sounds like to the individual, I mean, that's the Holy Grail. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) VODER-GENERATED VOICE: She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Hello. I am (unintelligible) machine.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The European Union opened an antitrust investigation today into Amazon. The EU regulators' central question is this. Does the Internet giant stifle competition by exploiting data it collects from other companies for its own benefit? NPR's Alina Selyukh reports the EU is focusing on Amazon's dual role as a seller and a platform for other sellers. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Amazon likes to present itself as a cultivator and supporter of small- and medium-sized businesses. It likes to highlight that most of its sales are products from other companies. These other merchants pay Amazon fees to sell on its platform. They also share a lot of their data with Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) MARGRETHE VESTAGER: And the question here is about the data. SELYUKH: That's EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager speaking about Amazon at a press conference in September. That's when her team at the European Commission started surveying the merchants who contract with Amazon. This research would later show that Amazon appears to use, quote, \"competitively sensitive information\" about the sellers, their products and transactions. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) VESTAGER: Do you then also use these data to do your own calculations, as, what is the new big thing? What is it that people want? What makes them buy things? SELYUKH: As in, does Amazon use the data it collects to its own advantage or in other anti-competitive ways? Now the European Commission is officially investigating that. This adds to a push by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to regulate how tech giants use the data of people and organizations on their platforms. The EU has led the charge with a sweeping privacy law and several fines against Google. And just today, German antitrust regulators announced a deal with Amazon to settle their own investigation into the marketplace. As a result, Amazon will make changes to the business terms it offers sellers and not just in Germany but worldwide. Amazon's use of data from sellers also came up this week at an antitrust hearing in Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATE SUTTON: And we don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them. SELYUKH: That's Amazon lawyer Nate Sutton carefully wording his answer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUTTON: The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy, regardless of the seller. SELYUKH: A note - Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters. In a statement, the company says it will cooperate fully with the EU regulators. If the EU finds Amazon in violation of Europe's competition rules, the retailer could face fines of up to 10% of a year's worth of global revenue. For Amazon, that could be tens of billions of dollars. Alina Selyukh, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Carole Cadwalladr: How Did Social Media Manipulate Our Votes And Our Elections? : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "GUY RAZ, HOST: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So on the morning of June 24, 2016, British citizens woke up stunned - almost no one, and certainly none of the polls, predicted the majority of them would support Brexit. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: How do you feel about Britain leaving the EU? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I'm quite shocked, to be honest. I thought we all would've stayed in. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, I didn't think anyone really believed that U.K. voters would decide to Brexit. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: And I feel quite shocked by the result. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: To be honest, I was quite shocked. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I feel quite scared today. I don't know how I feel. RAZ: I remember that morning. I happened to be in London. And the question a lot of people were asking was why? Why did it happen? And why did almost no one predict it? And these were also the questions journalist Carole Cadwalladr asked when she went to a small town in Wales. CAROLE CADWALLADR: It was years since I'd been to Ebbw Vale. It's a very historic, very, you know, real Labour, left-wing heartland. RAZ: That town, Ebbw Vale, voted overwhelmingly in favor of leaving the EU. And Carole wanted to understand why. CADWALLADR: And I went down this lower part of the town, which is where the steel plant used to be. And it was the biggest steel plant in the world, right up until - it was the '80s, I think. And you just had no idea now. It looked like (laughter) - you know, it was a kind of little Manhattan down there - these sort of incredible architecture-designed glass and steel buildings. And all around, these signs saying, paid for by the European Union. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Carole Cadwalladr picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CADWALLADR: I had this sort of weird sense of unreality walking around the town, and it came to a head when I met this young man in front of the sports center. And he told me that he had voted to leave because the European Union had done nothing for him - he was fed up with it. And all around town, people told me the same thing. And they told me that they were most fed up with the immigrants and with the refugees - they'd had enough. Which was odd because, walking around, I didn't meet any immigrants or refugees. And when I checked the figures, I discovered that Ebbw Vale actually has one of the lowest rates of immigration in the country. And so I was just a bit baffled because I couldn't really understand where people were getting their information from. But then after the article came out, this woman got in touch with me. And she was from Ebbw Vale, and she told me about all this stuff that she'd seen on Facebook. And I was like, what stuff? And she said it was all this quite scary stuff about immigration, especially about Turkey. So I tried to find it, but there was nothing there because there's no archive of ads that people see or what had been pushed into their news feeds. No trace of anything - it'd gone completely dark. Because only you see your news feed, and then it vanishes, so it's impossible to research anything. So we have no idea who saw what ads or what impact they had or what data was used to target these people or even who placed the ads or how much money was spent or even what nationality they were - but Facebook does. Facebook has these answers, and it's refused to give them to us. Our Parliament has asked Mark Zuckerberg multiple times to come to Britain and to give us these answers, and every single time, he's refused. And you have to wonder why. Because what I and other journalists have uncovered is that multiple crimes took place during the referendum, and they took place on Facebook. It's because in Britain we limit the amount of money that you can spend in an election. And it's because in the 19th century, people would walk around with, like, literally wheelbarrows of cash and just buy voters. So we passed these strict laws to stop that from happening. But those laws don't work anymore. This referendum took place almost entirely online. And you can spend any amount of money on Facebook or on Google or on YouTube ads, and nobody will know because they're black boxes, and this is what happened before the Brexit vote. We are what happens to a Western democracy when 100 years of electoral laws are disrupted by technology. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: And it's that technology that got Carole wondering - how many people might have been misled, even manipulated, into voting a certain way because of Facebook ads, ads that were designed to trigger certain emotions among voters? So Carole started to dig deeper, and over the next two years, she'd come to a very worrying conclusion about technology companies like Facebook and Twitter and even Google. CADWALLADR: You know, this is a massive, global online experiment going on right now, and it's being conducted by some of the - if not the smartest people in the world, who are being employed, paid huge salaries, to come up with new and novel ways to hook us and addict us and draw us in and make us click. I mean, it's old-fashioned corporate greed. These are highly motivated billionaires (laughter) hiring, you know, the smartest people to find new ways of manipulating us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Every day, every second, trillions of bits of data about you, me, everyone you know, are being collected every time we click a link or even scroll through a social media news feed. And all of that information allows some of the biggest technology companies to build a highly detailed profile of who you are, what triggers you, how to hook you in and, ultimately, how your behavior can be shifted. It's very possible that who we vote for, what we buy, what we believe, even what we see with our own eyes, are more susceptible to manipulation today than ever before in modern history. So on the show today, we're going to explore ideas around the power of digital technology to manipulate our decisions and ways to prevent it from becoming an even bigger problem. CADWALLADR: This is a really profound revolution in the way that we consume information. And I think it's really difficult to understand this massive historical change when you're in the middle of it, when you're - you can't see it. It's - you know, it is like the sun - it's too big to see. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CADWALLADR: I don't have to tell you that hate and fear are being sown online all across the world. But we only see a tiny amount of what's going on on the surface. And I only found out anything about this dark underbelly because I started looking into a company called Cambridge Analytica. And I spent months tracking down an ex-employee, Christopher Wiley. And he told me how this company that worked for both Trump and Brexit had profiled people politically in order to understand their individual fears, to better target them with Facebook ads. And it did this by illicitly harvesting the profiles of 87 million people from Facebook. The company is owned by Robert Mercer, the billionaire who bankrolled Trump. And he threatened to sue us multiple times to stop us from publishing. But we finally got there, and we were one day ahead of publication - we got another legal threat; not from Cambridge Analytica occur this time, but from Facebook. It told us that if we publish, they would sue us - we did it anyway. (APPLAUSE) CADWALLADR: Facebook, you are on the wrong side of history in that, and you are on the wrong side of history in this - in refusing to give us the answers that we need. And that is why I am here to address you directly, the gods of Silicon Valley. (APPLAUSE) CADWALLADR: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Jack Dorsey and your employees and your investors, too - this technology that you have invented has been amazing, but now it's a crime scene, and you have the evidence. And it is not enough to say that you will do better in the future. Because to have any hope of stopping this from happening again, we have to know the truth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Carole, if you had a chance to sit down with Mark Zuckerberg or some of these other founders and they had to answer your questions, what is it that you would want to know from them? Like, what are the things that they would need to say? CADWALLADR: I want to know how they can live with this, how they can not be taking an ax to, you know, what is currently going on internally. RAZ: Yeah. CADWALLADR: I want to sort of see that they recognize on a human level what is going - because they show no sign of it. The other thing about it is, is that, you know, in my TED Talk, I showed these advertisements which had been on Facebook. RAZ: Yeah. CADWALLADR: We got those after a sort of battle royal the - our Parliament had with Facebook, and then they eventually handed some of them over. But in the States, what is remarkable is you know even less about what happened in your presidential election than we do. And it is - the scale of what happened in the U.S. is so much bigger, so much more money which was spent, so much more sophisticated modelling - we know nothing about it. And, you know, and meanwhile, the U.S. is careering towards the next election. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CADWALLADR: This is not democracy, spreading lies in darkness; it's subversion. And it is not about left or right or leave or remain or Trump or not; it's about whether it's actually possible to have a free and fair election ever again. Because as it stands, I don't think it is. And so my question to you is, is this what you want? Facebook, is this how you want history to remember you, as the handmaidens to authoritarianism that is on the rise all across the world? Because you set out to connect people, and you are refusing to acknowledge that the same technology is now driving us apart. And my question to everybody else is, is this what we want, to let them get away with it and to sit back and play with our phones, as this darkness falls? Democracy is not guaranteed, and it is not inevitable, and we have to fight, and we have to win, and we cannot let these tech companies have this unchecked power. It's up to us - you, me and all of us. We are the ones who have to take back control. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: That's Carole Cadwalladr. She writes for The Guardian and The Observer.

Alastair Pike /AFP/Getty Images hide caption A Senate subcommittee is looking to see if Google is keeping conservative media and bloggers out of top search results. Updated at 5:15 p.m. ET Does Google have bias? It's the question that's at the center of a hearing Tuesday by a Senate Judiciary subcommittee. The hearing is probing into Google's search engine and whether it censors conservative media and bloggers out of the top search results. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the subcommittee chairman, called the hearing after Google failed to attend an April hearing on the topic. Facebook and Twitter attended. Cruz said he's concerned about Google's control over what people see on the Internet, and said previous legislation passed to protect tech companies was not created to \"empower large technology companies to control our speech.\" \"When you submit a video, people at YouTube determine whether you've engaged in hate speech, an ever-changing and vague standard meant to give censorship an air of legitimacy,\" Cruz said. \"This is a staggering amount of power to ban speech, to manipulate search results, to destroy rivals and to shape culture.\" President Trump has alleged that big tech companies have an anti-conservative bias. On Dec. 18, 2018, the president tweeted: \"Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!\" Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING! Google has denied the claim. \"Google needs to be useful for everyone, regardless of race, nationality or political leanings,\" Google's Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Karan Bhatia said at Tuesday's hearing. \"We have a strong business incentive to prevent anyone from interfering with the integrity of our products, or the results we provide to our users. Our platform reflects the online world that exists.\" A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Facebook and Google attended an April hearing. It should have said that Facebook and Twitter attended. A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Facebook and Google attended an April hearing.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is being sued by two people who said they were blocked from her popular Twitter account. Updated at 12:20 p.m. ET Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is being sued by two people who say they criticized her on Twitter and were then blocked from her account, which has more than 4.7 million followers. The two federal lawsuits were filed Tuesday, the same day a federal appeals court in New York upheld a lower court ruling that President Trump violated the First Amendment by blocking critics on Twitter. The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling said that because Trump uses his Twitter account as a public forum, he cannot bar people who disagree with him from taking part in an open dialogue. The lawsuits against Ocasio-Cortez were filed by Dov Hikind, a former New York state assemblyman, and Joseph Saladino, a social media personality who goes by the name Joey Salads and is running for Congress. Saladino announced his lawsuit Tuesday on Twitter, saying, \"Trump is not allowed to block people, will the standards apply equally? Stay tuned to find out!\" According to the court document he posted, Ocasio-Cortez blocked Saladino on May 9. Hikind's lawsuit states that he lost access to the freshman lawmaker's @AOC Twitter account on Monday, a day before the appeals court ruling on Trump's social media account. \"It was spectacular timing, it was godly in a sense, and I say that tongue in cheek,\" Hikind told NPR by phone from Israel. He added, \"I really don't think [the timing] matters, and since it happened, if she had courage, she would just do the right thing.\" Hikind said he was blocked after criticizing Ocasio-Cortez for equating migrant holding facilities at the U.S. southern border to concentration camps. Hikind accused her of blocking him \"purely because of his speech in support of Jewish values and Israel.\" Corbin Trent, a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez, told NPR that her office had no comment. Saladino, who is running as a Republican for a congressional seat representing Staten Island and Brooklyn, has about 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube and 104,000 followers on Twitter. He said he wants to use his social media skills to help conservatives with messaging after he \"suddenly realized his liberal friends were protecting the institutions and establishments that were hostile to Staten Island.\" Some of his videos have spurred accusations of racism. He also discussed his sex life in a Twitter thread. Some New York Democrats voiced their support for Ocasio-Cortez. \"Blocking people on social media \u2014 esp as women, typically subjected to an avalanche of hateful and misogynistic speech online \u2014 is not a violation of their First Amendment rights,\" said state Sen. Julia Salazar, D-Brooklyn. \"None of us have a constitutional right to use someone's Twitter to abuse them.\" Hikind said his criticism of Ocasio-Cortez focused on policy and never veered into vile territory. \"This is about every elected official,\" he told NPR. \"Just because you don't like what someone is saying, just because you can't deal with someone's criticism of your policy, 'I'll be deaf and dumb,' that's hopefully going to be history all over the country.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Dan Coats, Director Of National Intelligence, Picks Election Security Czar : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence, has announced he's created a new position to help coordinate government efforts to protect U.S. elections from outside interference. Intelligence officials have warned that the 2020 elections are still susceptible to attacks from foreign governments. NPR's Pam Fessler covers the issue and joins us in our studios. Pam, thanks so much for being with us. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: How does this position change what the government has already been doing? FESSLER: Well, Coats created this new position. It's called election threats executive. And a longtime intelligence official - her name is Shelby Pierson - is going to do the job. She's going to oversee and coordinate all the efforts in the intelligence community, gather information about what kind of threats are out there. But quite frankly, she did something very similar to this during the 2018 elections, but that was part-time; this is going to be full-time. And this really elevates the position. And I think mostly what it's doing is it's designed to send out a message that the government really takes this issue very, very seriously, and also to counter some concerns that the Trump administration hasn't been doing enough. It's worth noting that on multiple occasions, the president has expressed doubts about the conclusion by Dan Coats, the intelligence director, and the entire community, that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win. SIMON: Can you tell what kind of security threats they'll be on the lookout for? FESSLER: Well, there's been a lot of focus on the kind of thing that happened in 2016 when Russian intelligence tried to hack into state voter rolls. They also broke into the DNC's email system. And also, we had this massive disinformation campaign on social media. So it's a lot of concern about a repeat of that. But they're also worried about other bad actors in other countries. The Iranians, the North Koreans, the Chinese are all seen as potential threats, or it could even be somebody domestically. Earlier this week, interestingly, Microsoft said that it detected almost 800 cyberattack attempts over the past year against think tanks and U.S. political organizations. And that might be the sign of the kind of things that we're going to be seeing in 2020. And then this new intelligence effort - the whole purpose is to try and gather that information. SIMON: You often remind us in your reporting that elections, actually, are run on the state and local level, not the federal level. How is this new position, if it is, going to affect what they do to protect against interference? FESSLER: Well, it's interesting, actually. Ever since 2016, the Department of Homeland Security has been working really closely with state and local election officials to try and figure out, you know, how they can beef up their security. So that's going to continue. But, you know, they need intelligence to know what they should be doing and where the threat is coming from. So if the process works, this intelligence that's all being gathered will be shared with the state and local officials. Interestingly, they say, though, that they really need more money. Congress approved about $380 million last year for election security, but they say it's not enough. They're still using a lot of old voting equipment that's more vulnerable to attacks. A lot of them don't have IT professionals to help them with security. They say, well, it's great if we have all this intelligence about potential threats, but if we don't have the money to fix the problem, what good is it? SIMON: NPR's Pam Fessler, thanks so much.

On Friday he announced a new election security czar for the agency. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 6. On Friday he announced a new election security czar for the agency. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has installed a new czar to oversee election security efforts across the spy world, he announced on Friday. A veteran agency leader, Shelby Pierson, has been appointed to serve as the first election threats executive within the intelligence community, or IC, Coats said. \"Election security is an enduring challenge and a top priority for the IC,\" said Coats. \"In order to build on our successful approach to the 2018 elections, the IC must properly align its resources to bring the strongest level of support to this critical issue. There is no one more qualified to serve as the very first election threats executive than Shelby Pierson, whose knowledge and experience make her the right person to lead this critical mission.\" Pierson has served within the intelligence world for more than 20 years. She was \"crisis manager\" for election security for the 2018 election within the office of the DNI and also has served in top roles in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, according to one official biography. Her appointment isn't the only change Coats announced on Friday. He also is directing other agencies within the extended family of spy services to appoint their own executives responsible for election security efforts. \"These agency leads will work with the [election threats executive] to help ensure IC efforts on election security are coordinated and prioritized across all IC elements,\" Coats said. Many responsibilities, many letters The different agencies in the alphabet soup have different responsibilities for gathering, analyzing and acting upon the information they bring in. The FBI was responsible for much of the investigation of the Russian interference in the 2016 election, for example; the CIA runs human agents overseas; the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command focus on the global information grid, and so on. The intelligence community was not structured to handle the breadth of threats to American elections, which can range from sophisticated cyberattacks against political targets to widespread threats against state and local elections infrastructure, to targeted agitation on social media platforms. A given agency such as the Department of Homeland Security may take the lead in one area \u2014 like helping local elections officials better safeguard their systems \u2014 but not be involved closely with another area such as online agitation. Uncertain standing for the DNI The headlines on Friday about Coats' efforts within the intelligence community also provided a reminder about what could be his perilous position within the administration. Anonymous sources told correspondents for several news organizations earlier this month that Trump has been considering firing Coats, who has never appeared to mesh well with the president. One reason is ongoing tension between the intelligence community and Trump over its findings versus his wishes. Earlier this year, for example, the spy bosses told members of Congress they didn't believe North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un would ever surrender his nuclear weapons, even as Trump pursued a charm offensive with the dictator predicated upon a denuclearization program by the North. And election security itself has been described as a sore point between Trump and much of the national security leadership. The president goes back and forth as to what he accepts about it and what he doesn't, along with what should be done to protect elections. Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reportedly complained that she was told to keep her efforts on election security \"below his level.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota (from left), Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan respond to racist remarks directed at them by President Trump at a news conference on Monday. J. Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota (from left), Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan respond to racist remarks directed at them by President Trump at a news conference on Monday. Updated at 7 p.m. ET A group of four women lawmakers responded to attacks by President Trump with a news conference of their own on Monday evening. Earlier in the day, Trump said the members of Congress are \"free to leave\" the country if they are unhappy with the U.S. and accused them of hating America. Trump's remarks, made at an impromptu news conference in front of the White House, follow racist tweets that he sent on Sunday directed at Democratic freshmen Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 all women of color. Trump tweeted that they should \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came.\" (Omar was born in Somalia; the other three were all born in the United States.) Democrats were quick to denounce the tweets on Sunday, but Republicans were largely silent until Monday. Criticism grew as the president doubled down. Asked Monday if he was concerned that \"people saw the tweet as racist and that white nationalist groups are finding common cause with you on that point,\" Trump replied, \"It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me.\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the lawmakers' news conference, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\" She added that Trump \"does not know how to defend his policies, so what he does is attack us personally, and that is what this is all about.\" The lawmakers pointed to the administration's immigration policies in particular. Ocasio-Cortez was among those who recently visited a detention facility on the U.S.-Mexico border and testified about the harsh conditions she witnessed. Pointing to past comments Trump has made about women, African American athletes and neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Va., Omar said Trump was advocating \"the agenda of white nationalists.\" \"It's time for us to impeach this president,\" she said. Tlaib echoed her call for impeachment. Earlier in the day, Trump said in a tweet that the lawmakers should apologize \"to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President.\" When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions! Trump said \"the Radical Left Congresswomen\" should apologize for \"the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!\" Omar, whom Trump called out by name on Monday, tweeted, \"They are working to silence the voices of the people who see themselves represented in me. I will stay in the ring, fighting for what is right and will never back down in the face of these attacks.\" It\u2019s important to note that the President\u2019s words yday, telling four American Congresswomen of color \u201cgo back to your own country,\u201d is hallmark language of white supremacists.Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans. Democrats have widely criticized the president's Sunday tweets. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been at odds with the four members of her caucus, came to their defense Sunday. She tweeted that when Trump \"tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again.\" Pelosi added, \"Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.\" In his brief comments to reporters at the White House, Trump denied that his tweets were racist. \"Not at all,\" he said. Instead, Trump claimed it was Pelosi's remarks that were racist. Pelosi announced that the House will take up a resolution \"condemning the President's xenophobic tweets\" \u2014 a resolution that she said will be sponsored by Democratic lawmakers who were born overseas. Republicans stayed mostly quiet about Trump's tweets on Sunday, but several weighed in on Monday, critical of Trump's language. In an interview on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump should \"aim higher. ... They are American citizens. They won an election. Take on their policies.\" But Graham also said, \"We all know that [Ocasio-Cortez] and this crowd are a bunch of communists. They hate Israel. They hate our own country.\" Rep. Paul Mitchell, R-Mich., tweeted at Trump, \"we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.\" .@RealDonaldTrump, we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders. https://t.co/4b8e5hlSZI Another Michigan GOP lawmaker, Rep. Fred Upton, tweeted that he is \"appalled by the President's tweets,\" adding, \"There's no excuse.\" Upton also condemned what he labeled \"Inflammatory rhetoric from both sides of the aisle that is used to divide us.\" ...that we ought to be working on together \u2013 immigration, the debt ceiling, the border crisis. The President\u2019s tweets were flat out wrong and uncalled for, and I would encourage my colleagues from both parties to stop talking so much and start governing more. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., also issued a statement condemning the tweets. \"President Trump was wrong to suggest that four left-wing congresswomen should go back to where they came from. Three of the four were born in America and the citizenship of all four is as valid as mine,\" he said. \"I couldn't disagree more with these congresswomen's views on immigration, socialism, national security, and virtually every policy issue. But they are entitled to their opinions, however misguided they may be. We should defeat their ideas on the merits, not on the basis of their ancestry.\" One of the strongest reactions among Republicans came from Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who is the only African American Republican in the House. Hurd told CNN that the president's tweets were \"racist and xenophobic\" and said it was \"behavior that's unbecoming of the leader of the free world. He should be talking about things that unite us, not divide us.\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski tweeted, \"There is no excuse for the president's spiteful comments \u2013they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop.\" And Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Senate's only African American Republican, charged that the Democratic Party was \"embroiled in racial controversy,\" while also condemning the president's \"racially offensive language.\" No matter our political disagreements, aiming for the lowest common denominator will only divide our nation further. My full statement below: pic.twitter.com/QXuV8arXso Trump, who in a separate tweet on Saturday claimed 94% support from Republican Party members, seemed to welcome the storm he set off, saying in another tweet that it was \"sad\" to see Democrats \"sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion.\" Omar has faced controversy for remarks critical of Israel earlier this year that many deemed anti-Semitic. The House voted in March to condemn \"anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry,\" without explicitly naming Omar. While the Anti-Defamation League was among the groups to denounce Omar's comments, on Monday the anti-hate speech organization turned its criticism on Trump. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement: \"While ADL has publicly disagreed with these congresswomen on some issues, the president is echoing the racist talking points of white nationalists and cynically using the Jewish people and the state of Israel as a shield to double down on his remarks. Politicizing the widespread, bipartisan support for Israel and throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism is damaging to the security of Israel and the Jewish community. He should lead by example, stop politicizing these issues and stop smearing members of Congress.\" An earlier version of this story mistakenly said President Trump claimed 94% support from Republican Party members in a Sunday tweet. The tweet was actually on Saturday. An earlier version of this story mistakenly said President Trump claimed 94% support from Republican Party members in a Sunday tweet.

President Trump appears to have identified his newest American enemy \u2014 paper straws. His reelection campaign is selling reusable and recycled straws in its 2020 online store, and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale blasted the slurping nonsoggy alternative in an email titled \"Make Straws Great Again,\" a play on the president's famed slogan. \"I'm so over paper straws, and I'm sure you are too. Much like most liberal ideas, paper straws don't work and they fall apart instantly. That's why we just launched our latest product - Official Trump Straws,\" Parscale wrote late Friday. \"Now you can finally be free from liberal paper straws that fall apart within minutes and ruin your drink.\" Journalist Yashar Ali appears to have been the first to notice the new merchandise in Trump's campaign store. A pack of 10, which are red and emblazoned with \"TRUMP\" in silver, is available for $15. However, it takes almost two weeks for shipping. I thought it was a joke, but it\u2019s true...the Trump campaign is selling plastic straws. \u201cLiberal paper straws don\u2019t work.\u201d pic.twitter.com/6PIgsELCAk Parscale had registered his frustrations with the newest eco-friendly fad earlier this week on Twitter. I\u2019m so over paper straws. #LiberalProgress This is exactly what they would do to the economy as well. Squeeze it until it doesn\u2019t work. pic.twitter.com/zKfiZiSHV5 And earlier on Friday, Trump himself weighed in on the issue during a gaggle with reporters, saying, \"I do think we have bigger problems than plastic straws,\" arguing that plates and wrappers are also made of plastic but aren't receiving as much attention or disdain. \"Everybody focuses on the straws. There's a lot of other things to focus [on],\" he said. Many environmental groups have been pushing for alternatives to plastic disposable straws, which gained traction in the wake of a video showing a sea turtle with a plastic straw stuck up its nose. However, the paper alternatives that many restaurants have begun using often quickly become mushy and unusable as the liquid permeates them. There are nonpaper, nonplastic alternatives that are slowly gaining steam, including hay straws, bamboo straws, reusable metal straws or glass straws, or restaurants can encourage patrons not to use straws, as Starbucks has with new lids. This is hardly the first time Trump has tried transform such an issue into a partisan wedge and has especially taken glee time and time again in mocking environmental initiatives, such as the Green New Deal. He has also cast doubt on the reality of climate change. And it could also be his way of trying to distract from yet another rough week politically in the wake of his racist attacks on four Democratic freshmen congresswomen of color. The scourge of paper straws, however, isn't just a conservative issue, as Trump's campaign wants to frame it. Earlier this week, Sacha Haworth of the liberal opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century tweeted her own frustrations with paper straws. paper straws are terrible. i want my milkshake to taste like milkshake and not disintegrated newspaper. @ me, i'm ready (Full disclosure: This journalist, and many others, have also often tweeted about paper straw grievances). This also isn't the first time that efforts to make disposable dinnerware greener have been used as a political cudgel. After Democrats flipped the House in 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed to phase out plastic foam in the Capitol cafeterias and bring in \"corn-based, compostable dishes and utensils,\" according to The Hill. But when Republicans won back the House in 2010, they brought back the nonrecyclable plastic foam. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Toys \"R\" Us hide caption The retailer is rebranding itself with smaller stores and a focus on events and activities. Toys R Us is rising from the ashes. Now Americans may not have to go another Christmas without its once beloved toy store. The retailer is making a comeback in time for the 2019 holiday season with a new approach. Instead of providing mile-long aisles filled with a plethora of toys, the company is switching its focus to smaller stores that will feature interactive toy demonstrations, spaces for special events like birthday parties, new activities every day and open play areas. The plan was announced Thursday after Tru Kids Brand, the parent of Toys R Us, entered a joint venture with the startup b8ta, which owns a chain of \"experiential\" stores. The retailer has relaunched its website, touting an experience \"centered around product discovery and engagement.\" Although preferences and consumer shopping habits have changed over the years, \"what hasn't changed is that kids want to touch everything and simply \"play,\" said Phillip Raub, president of b8ta and interim co-CEO of the Toys R Us joint venture. Consumers will have the opportunity to play with toys displayed out of the box before potentially purchasing them. The company believes that this immersive experience, for example, will help it track patterns and measure how in-store retail experiences effect online sales. The first new stores will be in Texas and New Jersey. Toys \"R\" Us hide caption The first new stores will be in Texas and New Jersey. After officially closing its doors in nearly 200 locations in 2017, Toys R Us open the two new stores in The Galleria in Houston, Texas, and in the Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J. The stores will be nearly 6,500 square feet \u2014 roughly one third the size of its big-box stores. The joint partnership plans to open 10 additional stores in \"prime, high-traffic retail markets\" within the U.S. throughout 2020. Future store locations are planned to be about 10,000 square feet. They'll be \"the most progressive and advanced stores in its category in the world, and we hope to surprise and delight kids for generations to come,\" Vibhu Norby, CEO of b8ta said. As NPR previously reported, the chain employed more than 30,000 people in the U.S. before the bankruptcy. Tru Kids Brands said it wants to give hiring priority to former employees. Toys R Us declared bankruptcy after struggling with a heavy load of debt caused by a buyout in 2005, including competition from Amazon, Target and Walmart. The company owed more than $5 billion. Even as it went bankrupt, the original Toys R Us accounted for about a fifth of toy sales in the U.S. Tru Kids Brands currently operates more than 700 stores outside the U.S. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Toys R Us owed more than $5 million. The actual debt if more than $5 billion. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Toys R Us owed more than $5 million. The actual debt if more than $5 billion.

Elizabeth Williams/AP hide caption In this courtroom artist's sketch, defendant Jeffrey Epstein (left) and his attorney Martin Weinberg listen during a bail hearing Monday in federal court in New York. On Thursday, a judge said Epstein should remain in detention. Updated at 5:59 p.m. ET A federal judge in Manhattan has ordered that multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein remain confined while he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman announced his decision that the 66-year-old financier be held without bail on Thursday, following a hearing Monday in which Epstein's lawyer asked that his client be placed on house arrest with round-the-clock private security guards paid for by Epstein. In denying that request, the judge called the bail offer from Epstein's defense team \"irredeemably inadequate,\" saying his first priority in making the decision is weighing the danger Epstein posed to the community and to other potential victims. \"Mr. Epstein's dangerousness is considerable and includes sex crimes with minor girls and tampering with potential witnesses,\" Berman wrote in his order on Friday. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of one count of sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking conspiracy. He was arrested July 6 after his private plane landed at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport and was taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. Prosecutors had called Epstein a flight risk, noting that he owns two private jets and has traveled abroad more than 20 times in the past 18 months. They also feared he might try to obstruct justice, accusing him of tampering in a previous case by paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money to silence potential witnesses. Berman wrote since Epstein faces spending the rest of his life behind bars if convicted, he has the resources to try to escape if he would like to, helped along by his substantial wealth, connections and properties oversees. Epstein could choose to flee to a jurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty, the judge noted. \"The Court finds that the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant is a serious risk of flight and that no conditions can be set that will reasonably assure his appearance at trial,\" Berman wrote. In a filing opposing bail, prosecutors wrote that Epstein \"has already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation.\" Epstein's lawyers had asked that their client be issued an ankle bracelet and allowed to remain at his Manhattan mansion, which prosecutors estimated is worth $77 million. They said the registered sex offender has had a clean record since he was convicted as part of a plea agreement a decade ago. From at least 2002 to 2005, Epstein \"enticed and recruited\" girls as young as 14 to his houses in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., to engage in sex acts with him, according to the indictment. He allegedly paid some of the girls to recruit others in order to \"maintain and increase his supply of victims.\" Prosecutors said investigators have found evidence suggesting Epstein hasn't changed his ways. \"And any doubt that the defendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered hundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhattan mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime involving a juvenile,\" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman wrote the judge. In his written opinion, Berman reached the same conclusion. \"It seems fair to say that Mr. Epstein's future behavior will be consistent with past behavior.\" Epstein's victims also wanted him detained until trial, according to prosecutors: \"They believe it would be unfair to victims of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be in similar circumstances.\" The federal indictment in New York comes more than a decade after Epstein faced similar federal charges in Florida. He eventually pleaded guilty to two state felonies and served 13 months in county jail as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. The new charges heightened scrutiny of the decade-old deal Epstein brokered with prosecutors, which was negotiated by then-Miami U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Last week, Acosta announced that he was resigning from his current post as Labor secretary. Over the years, the well-connected financier has surrounded himself with famous people, including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton, who have recently distanced themselves from Epstein. He also has been represented by prominent lawyers such as Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr. Before Thursday's hearing, Epstein's lawyers and the government exchanged dueling filings about a mysterious passport that investigators found in a locked safe in his Manhattan mansion. Investigators say it was discovered along with \"piles of cash\" and diamonds. Government lawyers said the passport was issued by the government of Austria with Epstein's photo but another person's name. It showed travel to countries including France, Spain and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, according to the filing. Epstein's lawyers explained to the court that a friend gave Epstein the passport bearing a \"non-Jewish name,\" and that it was necessary \"in case of hijacking\" when traveling abroad.

        "title": "Opinion: Modern Republican Immigration Policy Bears No Resemblance To Lincoln's : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Should Republicans still call themselves the party of Lincoln? Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, declared, we are the party of Lincoln, as he contended President Trump was not racist for suggesting four Democratic representatives - U.S. citizens who are also women of color - should go back to the places they came from. But it might be telling to remember what Abraham Lincoln thought of a political movement of the 1850s called the American Party. They called themselves the Know-Nothings because they were encouraged to say they knew nothing about the secretive party's membership. The Know-Nothings detested and feared immigration. They believed an influx of Catholic immigrants from Germany and Ireland were part of a papal conspiracy to overthrow white Protestant America. They wanted to restrict immigration and keep foreign-born citizens from voting. The Know-Nothings were not a negligible splinter group. They won more than 40 seats in Congress in 1854. Millard Fillmore, their candidate for president in 1856, won 21% of the vote. Lincoln wrote his old friend Joshua Speed in 1855, I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can anyone who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that all men are created equal. We now practically read it, all men are created equal except Negroes. When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read, all men are created equal, except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics. Lincoln, like many great figures, can be quoted to bolster almost any position. But Sean Trainor, a lecturer at the University of Florida who has written about the period, told us modern Republican immigration policy bears no resemblance to the policies of Lincoln and his generation of Republicans. The party's founders fought against proposed limits on the number of immigrant arrivals. Today's Republicans do the opposite. Maybe no political party can forever be identified with its founders. Many Democrats no longer call their annual fundraisers Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners because Thomas Jefferson wrote all men are created equal but still owned slaves, and Andrew Jackson brutalized Native Americans. But can Republicans who don't see bigotry in President Trump's insult continue to claim Abe Lincoln as the brand name of their party?

The Trump administration has announced there will be changes to the U.S. citizenship test. Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption New citizens take the oath of allegiance during a naturalization ceremony in Oakland Park, Fla., earlier this year. The Trump administration has announced there will be changes to the U.S. citizenship test. The Trump administration is planning changes to the U.S. citizenship test. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says it is revising the test to ensure that \"it continues to serve as an accurate measure of a naturalization applicant's civics knowledge.\" The test was introduced in 1986 and last revised in 2008. In a USCIS statement, acting Director Ken Cuccinelli said, \"Updating, maintaining, and improving a test that is current and relevant is our responsibility as an agency in order to help potential new citizens fully understand the meaning of U.S. citizenship and the values that unite all Americans.\" We\u2019re improving the current naturalization test to ensure it will continue to accurately measure a naturalization applicant\u2019s civics knowledge and reflect best practices in adult education assessments. Since assuming office, President Trump has attempted to implement broad changes to U.S. immigration laws and policies. Last week, the Trump administration announced a new rule requiring asylum-seekers to first apply for asylum in at least one country they pass through on their journey to the U.S. The administration has also argued for a citizenship question to be added to the 2020 census. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang and Franco Ordonez reported on Trump's recent decision to drop those efforts. Instead, they wrote, Trump announced he \"would sign an executive order to obtain data about the U.S. citizenship and noncitizenship status of everyone living in the United States.\" Cuccinelli spoke with The Washington Post about changes to the U.S. citizenship test, which the USCIS plans to launch in December 2020 or early 2021. \"Isn't everybody always paranoid that this is used for ulterior purposes?\" Cuccinelli said. \"Of course, they're going to be sorely disappointed when it just looks like another version of a civics exam. I mean that's pretty much how it's going to look.\" In a statement, the USCIS said it had formed a naturalization test revision working group in December 2018 with \"members from across the agency.\" The USCIS said it is \"soliciting the input of experts in the field of adult education to ensure that this process is fair and transparent.\" The exam currently asks applicants 10 randomly generated questions from a list of 100. The questions focus on three subjects: American government, American history and integrated civics, which includes American geography, symbols and holidays. Applicants for U.S. citizenship must get at least six out of the 10 questions correct to pass the test. Last year, the USCIS naturalized more than 750,000 people, which the agency says is a five-year high. The USCIS reports a national pass rate of 90% for the citizenship test and says a pilot of its revisions will be rolled out this fall. Then-USCIS Director Francis Cissna first announced upcoming revisions to the test in May. Cissna wrote, \"Citizenship is the culmination of an immigrant's journey to fully join our nation and live with us in a common bond ... By revising this test every 10 years, we can ensure that the civics education requirements remain a meaningful aspect of the naturalization process.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Tania and Joseph's 3-year-old daughter, Sofi, plays with a car in the shade at a shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, last week. Customs and Border Protection officials are denying that a Border Patrol agent asked a 3-year-old girl to choose which of her parents would be sent back to Mexico. A Honduran couple named Tania and Joseph told NPR that an El Paso Border Patrol agent told them last week that the family would be separated \u2013 one parent would go to Mexico and the other would be allowed to take the children into the United States. They said the agent asked their 3-year-old daughter, Sofi, to choose which parent she wanted to go with. [NPR is not using migrants' last names in this story because they are in the middle of immigration proceedings.] In a statement, a CBP spokesman said the family was temporarily separated during processing. \"The mother and children were placed in a holding area with other female head of household family units and the father was held with other adult males. The child was not offered a choice between parents,\" the spokesman said. \"Mother, father and children were processed as a family unit and were transferred out of Border Patrol custody together under the same disposition.\" The family's lawyer, Linda Rivas of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, said Tania and Joseph have repeated their account that the agent told them the family would be separated and asked the younger daughter to choose which parent she would go with. The couple has two other children, a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. The CBP statement came four days after NPR asked the agency to respond to the allegations from Tania and Joseph. CBP would not answer NPR's questions about whether the agent told the family they would be separated after processing. \"During processing, our agents review each unique case, including criminal and immigration history, in determining an individual's disposition,\" the spokesman said. The family's description of an attempted family separation drew widespread criticism. Tania and her husband, Joseph, initially had to stay just across the border in Mexico under a Trump administration program that requires thousands of people to wait in northern Mexico cities while their immigration cases are heard in U.S. courts. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Tania and her husband, Joseph, initially had to stay just across the border in Mexico under a Trump administration program that requires thousands of people to wait in northern Mexico cities while their immigration cases are heard in U.S. courts. Tania, Joseph and the family crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso in April. Tania said the family fled to the United States to seek asylum after the gang MS-13 killed her mother and sister-in-law and then threatened her. The family was sent back to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, under a Trump administration program called Migrant Protection Protocol, which requires thousands of people to wait in dangerous northern Mexico cities while their immigration cases are heard in U.S. courts. At the family's initial hearing in an El Paso court on July 10, Rivas, the family's lawyer, told Immigration Judge Nathan Herbert that the family shouldn't be in MPP because Sofi had a serious heart condition and had suffered a heart attack. Herbert said he didn't have the authority to remove the family from MPP but asked a Department of Homeland Security attorney to take note of Rivas' concerns. A doctor examined Sofi the next day at a CBP facility and determined she had a serious heart condition, Rivas said. The doctor told the Border Patrol agent that the family shouldn't be sent back to Mexico, she said. According to Tania and Joseph, it was then that the agent told them the family would be separated. The children wrapped themselves around their father and began crying, they said. Tania and Joseph said the doctor, whose name they couldn't recall, told the agent over several hours that the family shouldn't be separated. The next day, July 12, another agent agreed to release the family together, Tania and Joseph said. Robert Moore is a freelance journalist based in El Paso.

Patrick Semansky/AP hide caption Former NSA contractor Harold Martin III pleaded guilty in March after he was accused of a massive theft of classified government information. A former National Security Agency contractor who pleaded guilty to stealing vast troves of classified material over the course of two decades has been sentenced to nine years in prison. Harold Martin III, 54, apologized before U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett handed down the sentence on Friday. \"My methods were wrong, illegal and highly questionable,\" Martin told the court in Baltimore, according to The Associated Press. Earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to \"willful retention of national defense information,\" a crime that carries a punishment of anywhere from no jail time to a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. His plea agreement called for a sentence of nine years in prison. Martin, who at the time worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, began to accumulate classified documents in his vehicle and at his home in Glen Burnie, Md., in the late 1990s. The Navy veteran held a Top Secret security clearance. He was arrested in August 2016, and the documents were found when the FBI searched his residence. Prosecutors have described his conduct as \"breathtaking in its longevity and scale.\" Shortly after his arrest, Martin's defense lawyers said that he took documents home to study for his job. But as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported, \"they say somewhere along the line that turned into some kind of bizarre compulsion, some kind of hoarding. ... And Martin wound up taking home so much stuff, he couldn't even absorb it all.\" His lawyers have also said hoarding was \"a part of a mental health issue,\" as Johnson reported. Over the years, he accumulated an enormous volume of material. A court filing said that investigators seized \"thousands of pages of documents and dozens of computers and other digital storage devices and media containing, conservatively, fifty terabytes of information.\" However, that amount was later estimated to be far lower. Many of the documents were marked \"Secret\" or \"Top Secret,\" according to prosecutors. \"The Defendant was in possession of an astonishing quantity of marked classified documents which he was not entitled to possess,\" prosecutors stated in court documents in 2016. \"Many of the marked documents were lying openly in his home office or stored in the backseat and trunk of his vehicle.\" Martin was not charged with passing along the information to any foreign government. The sensitivity of the documents is clear. Martin's plea deal includes a list of documents that it says contain descriptions of plans and targets of U.S. security operations.

Patrick McMullan/Getty Images hide caption Federal prosecutors announced charges of sex trafficking against wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein last week. He is seen here in 2005. Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier and sex offender, is due back in a New York court Thursday. Epstein is expected to learn from a federal judge whether he will be granted bail or has to remain behind bars as he awaits trial on new sex crimes charges involving underage girls. Lawyers for Epstein argue their client should await trial at his multimillion-dollar Manhattan mansion on house arrest. Prosecutors argue the well-connected money man is a flight risk, adding if he's not detained, Epstein's victims could be subjected to \"harassment and abuse by the defendant.\" Epstein is jailed at Metropolitan Correctional Center where he has been since his July 6 arrest at an airport in New Jersey. It's a facility that is accustomed to holding high profile terrorists and mobsters. Inmates have included former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the infamous Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, who got a sentence of life in prison plus 30 years on Wednesday. If federal prosecutors and lawyers representing his accusers have their way, Epstein will stay put. Since federal prosecutors slapped Epstein, 66, with new sex trafficking charges charges last week, a bright light and a long shadow has been cast on his alleged predatory behavior that, so far, spans three states \u2014 Florida, New York and New Mexico. It has also forced a Trump Cabinet secretary to resign his post and the president himself to assert he wasn't \"a fan\" of Epstein, despite the financier's visits to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Tape of Trump and Epstein surfaces On Wednesday, NBC released video from its archives, showing Trump partying with cheerleaders from the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins NFL teams in 1992. Trump is seen dancing with women, even patting one on the derri\u00e8re. At one point, Trump ushers Epstein and two other men join the party at the venue. That video was shot more a decade and a half before Epstein entered a plea deal with then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta in Miami. Acosta, who announced last week that Friday will be his last day as Secretary of Labor, could not escape the glare of the Epstein case as he was dogged by questions of his handling of the what many say was a sweetheart plea deal for Epstein years ago. Epstein had been charged with crimes similar to those he's facing in New York, including recruiting dozens of underage girls, some as young as 13, for erotic massages and sex at his Palm Beach, Fla., home. Under the plea agreement brokered by Acosta, Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to lesser state prostitution charges and made to register as a sex offender. The deal also included immunity from federal prosecution and a 13-month sentence where he spent most of his days at his Palm Beach office.

Allegations of Abuse During Epstein's Jail Time At a press conference Tuesday, attorney Brad Edwards, who represents some women who say they were abused by Epstein as teenagers, claimed that Epstein continued his predatory behavior during his work release from a Palm Beach-area jail in 2008 and 2009. \"He was having office visitors, some that were flown to him from New York, and continuing to engage in similar conduct literally while he was in quote-unquote jail,\" Edwards told reporters. Edwards said, \"I don't know that any of his visitors were underage. ... I do know that he was able to have visitors that were under the age of 21, [and that at least one said she was there for] \"improper sexual contact.\" He declined to provide more details, citing ongoing litigation. A public affairs official with Palm Beach Sheriff's Office said in a statement that \"Epstein was carefully guarded.\" The statement said more than 464 reports were filed by deputies, adding that \"he was allowed NO family, friends or guests. His attorney or business partner ONLY.\" Palm Beach Sheriff's officials also point to a YouTube video of Palm Beach Chief Deputy Michael Gauger's interview for a documentary film in April. Gauger described Epstein's behavior during his sentence as \"excellent.\" \"If Mr. Epstein would have violated any condition of that work release ... then he would have immediately been arrested and taken into custody and brought back to the stockade and all privileges would have ceased,\" Gauger said. Gauger also said Epstein was picked up by a driver, who would take Epstein to his office where Epstein was met by a \"permit deputy\" which Epstein paid for. He allowed to be out of jail most days from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Courtney Wild, an Epstein accuser who is suing the federal government over the 2008 plea agreement, appeared at the press conference with her attorney, Edwards, and urged other victims to come forward. \"I was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein as a child,\" Wild said. \"In 2008, the U.S. attorney in Florida gave him a free pass on abusing me and many other victims.\" Wild said she was not surprised Epstein abused other girls in New York. \"He did it everywhere. And as long as the victims speak up, he isn't going to get away this time.\" Accusations of 'A Flight Risk' and Witness Tampering Prior to Thursday's court proceedings, lawyers for Epstein lobbied the court to allow him to be detained on house arrest at his Upper East Side mansion. He agreed to turn over his passport, wear an electronic monitor and forfeit his jet. In court documents, prosecutors said the collateral was \"plainly insufficient,\" saying Epstein's wealth \u2014 \"more than $500 million\" \u2014 could be used to help him flee. Prosecutors also point to the Manhattan residence as being a site of the alleged crimes as reason to deny Epstein's request. During Epstein's court appearance on Monday, federal prosecutors said investigators found \"piles of cash,\" diamonds and an expired foreign passport during a raid following his arrest. In court filings filed last week, federal prosecutors in New York said they have evidence Epstein used a trust account to pay $350,000 to two associates in an effort to \"influence individuals who were close to him\" who might be witnesses against him at trial. All of this comes on the heels of news of an active investigation into Epstein's activities in New Mexico. He has a property there called Zorro Ranch, which he built decades ago, and where some of Epstein's victims say they were abused. In an interview with NPR's Ari Shapiro, Hector Balderas, New Mexico's attorney general said state authorities were meeting with \"survivors and victims involved in the matter.\" \"I'm very concerned that there definitely was a course of conduct here in New Mexico within our borders and that we don't leave any stone unturned,\" Balderas said. He added that while New Mexico didn't have a human trafficking statute that would cover any of Epstein's alleged acts there, any evidence pertaining to the case found in his state will be forwarded to federal authorities in New York.

Paul Sancya/AP hide caption Kayakers paddle in a canal leading to the Detroit River in Detroit, Mich. Temperatures are soaring across much of the U.S. this week. Dangerously hot weather is hitting most of the U.S. this week, the National Weather Service says. Temperatures are expected to soar across the Central and Eastern United States. The heat wave is covering the Central Plains from Eastern Colorado into Kansas, and extending up to the Great Lakes. By Saturday it will blanket much of the East Coast from Virginia up through New York City, where temperatures are expected to reach or be close to 100 degrees. Gentry Trotter is a founder of Cool Down St. Louis, a nonprofit group in St. Louis, Mo., which helps low-income families with their utility bills and donates air conditioners to people who are elderly or have physical disabilities. Trotter tells NPR, \"It's been very hectic. It has been blazing hot. What we're worried about now is making sure that people, especially seniors and the physically disabled, stay hydrated. That they have a place to be cool at.\" A woman cools off in the fountain at Washington Square Park in New York. Temperatures at or close to 100 degrees are expected in the city this weekend. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption A woman cools off in the fountain at Washington Square Park in New York. Temperatures at or close to 100 degrees are expected in the city this weekend. Meteorologists say a high-pressure heat dome will trap summer heat across much of the country, smashing records. Richard Bann, with the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, tells NPR the dome will deflect weather patterns around its periphery. \"Global disturbances won't penetrate [the heat dome],\" Bann says. \"They might just move around this big dome of heat. We get maybe a few showers and maybe a few thunderstorms at the core of this, but it's basically a part of the atmosphere where it's warmest at the center of this dome.\" That's one way to beat the heat \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 #Florida #heatwave pic.twitter.com/dmGQETMBKl The heat wave is caused by a jet stream moving north, which allows tropical hot air from the Gulf of Mexico and the tropical Atlantic to stream northward over the eastern half of North America. The intensity and length of this heat wave is unusual. It is expected to last for several days. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center, told NPR the frequency of heat waves is increasing, and their persistence is likely linked to climate change. \"We're seeing heat waves ride on a background temperature that is just getting warmer. So if you've got a situation where temperatures are ten degrees warmer than normal, normal itself is actually getting warmer. So a heat wave that might have happened back in the 50s, is going to be a lot hotter now,\" Francis said. \"Another aspect that we see connected to climate change but that you don't hear about as much is the fact that there is also a lot more water vapor in the atmosphere now. As we warm the oceans and warm the air, there is more evaporation, and that water vapor makes us feel hotter.\" Water vapor is what creates the heat index, which is the combination of temperature plus how much moisture is in the air. A rising heat index means dangerous conditions for the young, elderly or others whose health may already be compromised. The National Weather Service advises people to drink plenty of water; stay out of the sun and in air-conditioned rooms; and to check on relatives, neighbors and the elderly. Look at the impressive and widespread coverage of #heat related warnings and advisories across the Eastern two-thirds of the country. The hazy, hot and humid conditions will persist through the weekend.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: In Puerto Rico last night, the old colonial section of San Juan looked a little bit like a war zone. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST AMBIANCE) KING: Police fired tear gas. They shot at protesters with rubber bullets and threw flash grenades. These protests started out peacefully during the day, but by evening, things had gotten chaotic. Puerto Rico has never really seen protests like this. People want their governor, Ricardo Rossello, to resign, but he is refusing, and so the protests keep getting bigger. Adrian Florido of NPR's Code Switch team is in San Juan. Hey, Adrian. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Hi, Noel. KING: So protests of this size are really unusual in Puerto Rico. You were there yesterday. What'd you see? How big was it? FLORIDO: I mean, it's hard to say for sure how big it was - there are no official estimates - but there were many, many thousands of people. During the height of the protest, it was really hard to even just move through the streets of Old San Juan there were so many people. And you're right. It was an unprecedented night of political protest against a sitting governor. This sort of thing doesn't really happen - hasn't ever happened in Puerto Rico. One reason it was so big was because of international famous artists from Puerto Rico - Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin, the rapper Residente - who all called on people to come out. But, you know, the other is that Puerto Ricans are just really angry. They're really angry and fed up with their governor and with their government, and they've had enough of it. KING: Things started out, as we said, pretty peacefully during the day. And then, at night, it sort of descended into chaos. What happened? FLORIDO: Yeah. I mean, after nightfall, sort of, you know, the energy changed at the protest. You know, you could sort of start to feel tensions rising as some of the more aggressive protesters started to confront police a little bit more. And then at some point, there was a trigger of some sort, and the tear gas started flying, and the rocks started being hurled. And then things devolved into chaos. And so it was a chaotic end to what was otherwise a very peaceful protest. KING: Why are people so insistent that the governor resign? Remind us what he has done here. FLORIDO: Well, the thing that sparked these protests initially over the weekend was the publication of these leaked text messages between him and members of his inner circle in which they used really offensive language to talk about political opponents, women and, really, everyday Puerto Ricans. Puerto Ricans were really offended by these text messages. But, really, it was kind of the final straw for Puerto Ricans, who have been really frustrated about a lot of things on their island for a long time - the economic crisis, the fact that they feel like the government's often corrupt, cronyism, the slow response and recovery from Hurricane Maria. And then to see their leaders making light of a lot of the struggles of everyday Puerto Ricans - it just became too much, and people took to the streets. KING: Is there any sign that Rossello is going to listen and step down, given that things are getting large and violent now? FLORIDO: He has been insistent that he is not going to step down. He has been, you know, facing increasing pressure from, obviously, the protesters, but also his political allies, his political opponents. There has been talk within the Puerto Rican Legislature of beginning impeachment proceedings, but that is unclear whether it's going to happen. Protesters say they're going to continue taking to the streets until he either steps down or is removed from office. KING: Adrian Florido of NPR's Code Switch team. Thanks, Adrian.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli must remain in prison for securities fraud, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. Shkreli is seen here in 2017, speaking after the jury reached a verdict in his case in a federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y. Martin Shkreli \u2014 the former pharmaceutical CEO widely known as \"Pharma Bro\" \u2014 lost his bid to overturn a seven-year prison sentence for fraud Thursday. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit affirmed Shkreli's 2017 conviction. The appeals court judges ruled against Shkreli by a 3-0 vote. In addition to ordering him to stay in prison, the judges affirmed that he must forfeit more than $7.3 million, pay restitution of $388,336 and pay a $75,000 fine. Shkreli gained a high profile in 2015 when, as the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, he hiked the price of the lifesaving HIV drug Daraprim by more than 5,000%. His prison term is unrelated to that infamous move; instead, Shkreli was found guilty of securities fraud after being accused of cheating investors in two failed hedge funds and another drug company Retrophin, which he formerly ran. Shkreli was convicted in August 2017 on three out of eight fraud charges; he could have been sentenced to a prison term as long as 20 years. In Shkreli's appeal, his defense team said the judge had confused the jury. Attorney Mark Baker said that when the jurors began their deliberations, \"the same instruction was given two different ways, as to two separate frauds with two disparate results, based on the same conduct.\" Their complaint centers on the district judge's inclusion of what's known as a \"no ultimate harm\" (NUH) instruction to the jury. During the appeals hearing in late June, Shkreli's team said such an instruction isn't appropriate for a securities fraud case \u2014 and that the judge also wasn't consistent in the wording of the instructions. Speaking for the government, Alixandra Smith of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York countered that the NUH instruction wasn't wrong \u2014 just more precise. \"It is hard to see how a more precise instruction could be somehow prejudicial or problematic than sort of a more general instruction,\" Smith said. Explaining the \"no ultimate harm\" concept, Smith said it's about intent. As an example, she told the court: \"I can't lie to you on Day 1 and tell you, 'Invest with me, I have a million dollars' \u2014 or as Mr. Shkreli did, for example, say $100 million \u2014 because I believe on Day 10 that I may come into that $100 million. \"It doesn't change my intent on Day 1, when I know that I'm lying because I don't have it yet,\" Smith said. The NUH instruction, she added, is meant to prevent the \"legally improper\" defense that because the fraudster believed everything would all work out, they could not have been lying.

Last week, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking of minors. Patrick McMullan/Getty Images hide caption The New York Times first reported last week that eight former Dalton students said the way Jeffrey Epstein interacted with teenage girls had stuck with them since high school. Last week, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking of minors. Most former Dalton School students agree on at least one thing: Jeffrey Epstein was charismatic. \"If you had had him [as a teacher] then, you would've liked him, too,\" says Eve Scheuer Lubin, who was Epstein's student during his brief tenure as a teacher in the mid-70s. The Dalton School, where he taught, is a private school in Manhattan with a reputation for attracting talented students and affluent parents. Decades later, Epstein is known for having friends in high places \u2014 from Washington to Hollywood. Now he's in jail, awaiting trial on allegations that he sexually abused dozens of underaged girls. Beyond the charisma, former students paint divergent portraits of the young, soon-to-be financier. Some remember a skilled educator, intelligent and quick-witted. Others recall a too-young teacher who was smarmy, unqualified and casually social with students. The New York Times first reported last week that eight former Dalton students said the way Epstein interacted with teenage girls had stuck with them since high school. Several former students told NPR they remember seeing Epstein surrounded by female students at Dalton, though none recalled any incidents of misconduct. \"It was just kind of a general circle of girls,\" says Scott Spizer, who graduated from Dalton in 1976. \"He was much more present amongst the students, specifically the girl students, during nonteaching hours ... it seemed just, it was kind of inappropriate.\" \"There was a mild sense of creepiness,\" says Kerry Lawrence, also in the class of 1976. \"When you had a faculty member that girls were paying attention to, it was somewhat disconcerting.\" But Scheuer Lubin, who was Epstein's student for three years, remembers it differently. \"He didn't touch girls or anything \u2014 they all hung out around him because he was handsome in his sleazy polyester pants,\" she says. Today, Epstein is at the center of a high-profile sex trafficking case that, according to prosecutors, involved dozens of girls. Epstein was charged last week with sex trafficking of minors in a federal court in Manhattan. NPR reached out to Epstein's lawyers for this story, but they did not respond to requests for comment. None of these charges are connected to his brief stint at the Dalton School, though prosecutors have raised the question in the past. In a 2009 deposition, an attorney asked Epstein if he ever had any \"sexual contact\" with female students he was teaching at Dalton. Epstein returned the question with his own: \"While I was a teacher?\" When Epstein answered 'No,' the prosecutor asked if he'd had any sexual encounters with students after he left the school. Epstein responded, \"Not that I remember.\" Then he was asked if he had dated anyone who was previously his student at Dalton. Epstein invoked the Fifth, Sixth and 14th Amendments and declined to answer. The Dalton School did not respond to NPR's request for comment on this story. That deposition came two years after Epstein avoided prison time for charges in Florida after a lenient plea deal with then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who resigned last week from his post as U.S. secretary of labor. Now, prosecutors say access to money and influential contacts \u2014 the type of which Epstein encountered at Dalton \u2014 aided him in his alleged crimes. On Thursday, Epstein's request for bail was rejected, in part because his vast wealth and ties to prominent people the world over make him a \"flight risk.\" At the Dalton School, Epstein encountered the rich and powerful; their children were all around him, taking classes and walking the halls. Among the students attending Dalton while Epstein was there were Rupert Murdoch's daughter, Prudence Murdoch, and soon-to-be actresses, such as Dirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey. It wasn't just the students; the leadership at Dalton was star-studded, too. Around the time Epstein arrived at the school, Donald Barr \u2014 Attorney General William Barr's father \u2014 was ending his tenure as the school's headmaster. Susan Semel, who taught social studies at Dalton from 1965 to 1988 and wrote a book on the school's history, says Barr made several unconventional hires during his time as the head of the school, though it's unclear if he hired Epstein. \"Donald Barr would hire young people, and not necessarily young people who had a lot of credentials,\" Semel says. Epstein was 21 when he started teaching at the school and had no college degree. \"If you look through ... my senior class,\" says Lawrence, a former Dalton student, \"I think you could have plugged his picture in there, and he could have easily passed for a high school student.\" Lawrence, an attorney, used to be a federal prosecutor in the office now prosecuting Epstein. Other students remember Epstein as a good teacher, regardless of age. \"I made sure I was in his algebra class,\" Scheuer Lubin says. But Millicent Young says Epstein was an aberrant hire for Dalton, and lacked the authoritativeness she associated with most teachers. \"That clear distinction between who is an adult here, and who is a child here, was not what resonated in my observations of him,\" says Young, who didn't have Epstein as a teacher but remembers watching him in the hallways and in the math lab. Peter Branch, who served as interim headmaster after Barr, told The New York Times that Epstein was eventually dismissed because his teaching \"didn't come up to snuff.\" He added that he doesn't remember getting any complaints about Epstein's behavior with students. After Dalton, Epstein went on to work at the investment bank Bear Stearns. According to the Miami Herald, Epstein got the job because an impressed parent told one of the bank's executives, Alan Greenberg, to hire Epstein. \"Give Jeff credit. He was brilliant,\" Lynne Koeppel, Greenberg's daughter, told the Miami Herald. \"He was very smart and he knew how to woo people, how to schmooze.\" Semel told NPR she remembers Epstein being taken with the \"glitz and ritz\" at Dalton; the school's wealthy and influential student and parent body. \"You have people who are the movers and shakers of New York sending their kids to a school where teachers are making modest salaries,\" she says. The Dalton footprint is certainly a large one. Famous alumni include Anderson Cooper and Claire Danes, according to Forbes' prep school ranking. Even two of the U.S. district judges who might have been assigned to Epstein's case went to Dalton. But on Thursday morning, it was Judge Richard Berman \u2014 who didn't attend the Manhattan prep school \u2014 who rejected Epstein's request to be detained on house arrest at his mansion on the Upper East Side. Instead, Epstein will await trial in jail. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

It was the fifth day in a row of protests in the U.S. territory. Some of Puerto Rico's biggest stars rallied a crowd of many thousands in San Juan on Wednesday, calling on the island's governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, to resign. It was the fifth day in a row of protests in the U.S. territory, following a leak of hundreds of pages of misogynistic and homophobic texts between the governor and his main advisers. During the day, trap artist Bad Bunny and singer Ricky Martin were among the huge crowd that marched to the governor's mansion. Tensions ratcheted up in the evening as protesters burst through a barricade at the governor's mansion and security forces fired tear gas at the crowd, causing many to flee into surrounding streets. A livestream from Puerto Rican news site El Nuevo D\u00eda showed chaotic scenes of demonstrators confronting riot police a few minutes after midnight local time. By early hours Thursday, the old city of San Juan resembled a war zone, with police chasing protesters through the streets while firing rubber bullets, gas canisters and what appeared to be flash bombs. Earlier, demonstrators wearing gas masks and hard hats set a pile of garbage on fire in a plaza, and police quickly fired tear gas at them. A street was shown littered with debris and broken glass. As El Nuevo D\u00eda reported, police spokesperson Axel Valencia said five people were arrested and two people were reported injured. He said several senior police officers were in the area and ordered the protesters to stand down. \"They were given verbal commands to cease and desist what they were doing. They were throwing rocks, quarter sticks of dynamite. They were throwing many things,\" Valencia said, according to the news site. \"You all saw how close they got to the fences of the perimeter, and well, there came a moment when our personnel had to use tear gases.\" The protests have been gaining momentum every day with high-profile support, including from Lin-Manuel Miranda, who led a demonstration in New York calling on Rossell\u00f3 to step down. Police used tear gas against protesters on Wednesday in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Police used tear gas against protesters on Wednesday in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Rossell\u00f3 has apologized for the texts but has insisted that he intends to remain in office. In the private chat messages published on Saturday by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism, the governor and his inner circle use misogynistic language to talk about women. They use homophobic language to talk about journalists and Ricky Martin. They engage in fat-shaming. They talk about manipulating the media and public opinion polls. And they make jokes about shooting the mayor of San Juan. The governor's chief financial officers made a joke about the dead bodies that piled up in a government facility before and after Hurricane Maria in 2017. That comment has been particularly galling for many Puerto Ricans still recovering from the deadly storm nearly two years later. The island is suffering from far more problems than the hurricane. It's been mired in an economic recession for more than a decade, including a debt crisis that has resulted in slashing public services and the imposition of a federal oversight board that has taken control of Puerto Rico's finances. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced leave the island, a trend that accelerated after the hurricane. For many residents, the chats have become a representation in black and white of the indifference they feel their leaders have for their daily struggles. Protesters say they expect demonstrations to get bigger should the governor continue clinging to office. Thousands of demonstrators are calling on Rossell\u00f3 to step down after a group chat was exposed that included misogynistic and homophobic comments. The sign reads \"Ricky Resign.\" Jose Jimenez/Getty Images hide caption The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images hide caption New York Attorney General Letitia James joins a press conference to support rent controlled tenants who have been threatened with eviction because their landlord has filed for bankruptcy in March. New York landlords are attacking rent regulations in a new federal lawsuit, claiming that capping what they can charge tenants in rent is equivalent to an illegal taking of property. Last month, housing advocates in New York celebrated sweeping new laws that established rent control permanently and extended tenant protections beyond just New York City, allowing cities throughout New York to opt into rent stabilization programs, which limit how much rent can be increased. In New York City, those rent caps affect about 1 million apartments, and landlord groups say the regulations not only deprive them of income, but the rules also violate their constitutional rights. The Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade group that represents 4,000 building owners, joined other landlord plaintiffs in the lawsuit arguing that rent stabilization laws \"effect a physical taking of property in violation of the Constitution's Takings Clause,\" according to the suit, citing a clause of the Fifth Amendment. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn this week, is not asking for monetary damages, but instead seeks to have New York's new rent stabilization laws thrown out. \"The Rent Stabilization Laws, among other things, deprive property owners of a reasonable market return on their investment, devalue their properties, and upset their investment-backed expectations,\" wrote lawyer Reginald Goeke, who is representing the building owners and landlords. The suit says those who benefit the most from the rent rules are not cash-strapped, but rather, affluent residents in Manhattan. Because of this, the suit argues, the rent laws \"cannot be justified\" on the grounds that the regulations help stabilize the cost of living for low-income families. According to the suit, the laws also encourage tenants to stay in their apartments for a long time, even when a family may need more space. As a consequence, rent stabilized units have low turnover and keep vacancy rates low, which usually means housing costs go up, the suit argues. Taken together, the rent laws are \"arbitrary and irrational,\" the suit contends. Courts have upheld rent stabilization laws in New York in recent years and the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the government's right to regulate rent going back to 1921, when the controls were put in place to combat the rising cost of housing. Yet landlord advocacy groups argue the new court challenge may still have a chance of dismantling rent stabilization laws because, as they see it, the latest batch of New York rent rules are more extreme than past regulations. Mike McKee, a tenant organizer with TenantsPAC, doesn't think so. He said the plaintiffs in the case are trying to defeat renter protections with an old argument that has a bad track record. \"They have a very weak argument. They have lost in court with this case for almost a hundred years,\" McKee told NPR. \"These arguments haven't won again, again and again. It's not going to win this time either.\" McKee said landlord complaints that the laws will crimp earnings have been overstated. \"They're still going to make a profit, they just won't make as much as fast,\" McKee said. Among the reforms in the the tenants' rights bill signed last month was a measure that eliminated a landlord's ability to take a unit out of stabilization based on a tenant's income. Such a change was necessary, McKee said, since thousands of rent stabilized units have been taken out of stabilization over the years. McKee's opposition to the lawsuit is joined by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who said in a statement that her office is committed to defending the state's rent stabilization laws. James said the tenant protections are \"a critical step in reforming the state's broken rent regulation system \u2014 a system that bad-acting landlords have manipulated and controlled for far too long.\" Rent control laws exist in cities around the country, including in New Jersey, California, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Earlier this year, Oregon became the first state to institute rent control statewide. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

For one West Philadelphia man, the answer was: Get to the outside of the building and scramble down more than a dozen floors. The breathtaking feat was captured in detail by multiple local television stations, bringing us several views of the man descending at least 14 floors of the tall building with apparent ease. In footage captured by NBC10 Philadelphia, the man makes his way down with astonishing speed. He's within one floor of the ground within about three minutes. \"He climbed about 200 feet down on what looked like basically chain-link fencing and then the railings of each apartment building,\" NBC10 Philadelphia helicopter pilot Jeremy Haas told the station. \"Once the man reached the ground he was greeted by waiting police officers before walking away,\" the NBC station said, adding that the man appeared unharmed. He has not been identified. It's not clear why the man opted to evacuate this way. Smoke or flames were not clearly visible as he made his way down.

        "title": "Acting Head Of Customs And Border Protection Says New Asylum Rule In 'Pilot' Phase : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When the acting director of Homeland Security testified before Congress today, the most pointed questions were about immigration and the U.S. border with Mexico. In another part of the program we're going to hear from lawmakers who questioned the acting secretary today. Now we're going to talk with the man who oversees U.S. immigration policy at the border. Mark Morgan is the Trump administration's acting head of Customs and Border Protection. He took that job two weeks ago, after just over a month as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Welcome to the studio. MARK MORGAN: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: Let me begin, Commissioner Morgan, by asking you about big changes that have happened just in the two weeks that you've been on the job. One is that people seeking asylum are now required to petition for asylum in a country that they pass through on the way to the United States. U.S. border officials have said they had less than a day's notice to implement this change; they weren't fully briefed on the policy. Is that a recipe for success? MORGAN: Yes, it is. And so you've got to remember - when a new policy like this is going to happen, although the new federal regulation allows us to apply that all 2,000 miles along the southwest border, we're not going to do that. So we're really piloting it in just one location. That location is briefed, and they know what to do and how to do that. SHAPIRO: Do you anticipate that this is going to expand along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, and if so, what's the timeline for that? MORGAN: That would be the goal. Right now, though, we've already - two lawsuits - one, I believe, in California and D.C., looking to enjoin - we're actually anticipating that probably the regulation will be enjoined, and then we'll have to go from there, as - unfortunately, many times this happens. But that would be the goal. Timeline is always dependent on how successful the pilot is and what we learn from that going forward. So I wouldn't be able to give you a timeline. SHAPIRO: Depends on success of the program and litigation? MORGAN: Correct. Exactly. Exactly. SHAPIRO: The whole country, I think, reacted to a photograph we saw a few weeks ago of a father and daughter who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande. MORGAN: Tragic. SHAPIRO: Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his 23-month-old child Valeria. Previously, people could present themselves in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation that they might be granted asylum. Now that they are expected to present themselves in a country that they pass through... MORGAN: Correct. SHAPIRO: ...If they want to enter the U.S., that door is effectively closed. Do you fear that more people will risk their lives trying to cross, the way that Oscar and Valeria did? MORGAN: So remember - it's not closed; it just means that now, that initial credible fear application has been taken away from them. They can still come and apply for a higher degree of asylum, and they're still going to go through a process here. I think that's key. It's not that they're barred from that. But what I would say is we're actually trying to prevent these individuals from taking the long trek. The picture you just described of the father, who - he jumped in the Rio Grande to save his daughter, right? We don't want that. We don't want them taking this - a perilous trek to do that. That's part of this whole process here. Meanwhile, keep in mind - that's happening. Who's getting rich doing that? The cartels. It's a multibillion dollar business. SHAPIRO: But I just have to ask one more time... MORGAN: Sure. SHAPIRO: ...Given that people want to enter the U.S. and the bar has been raised farther, do you think more people are going to take those risky paths that you would prefer they not take and put their lives in danger? MORGAN: No, what I'm hoping is that they realize that coming here illegally and taking that perilous trek is not going to get them entry, that they'll stop coming. SHAPIRO: Commissioner Morgan, one reason that President Trump wanted you in this position is that you have consistently defended his immigration policies on cable news. This is something that you said to Tucker Carlson on Fox News in January. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\") MORGAN: I've been to the detention facilities, where I've walked up to these individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, and I've looked at them, and I've looked at their eyes, Tucker, and I said that is a soon-to-be MS-13 gang member. It's unequivocal. SHAPIRO: Do you regret those remarks? MORGAN: So no, I don't - I think when you look back and you're out there and you're putting yourself out there and you're talking a lot, would I say I wish I would have rephrased it? Yes. Yes, absolutely. I think I wish I would have phrased it is that - I think what I'm absolutely looking at is potential gang members, and the facts prove that out. A couple of years ago ICE did an operation where they went after and they apprehended a lot of gang members. Forty percent of those gang members came in under the family unit or unaccompanied minor program. So people join gangs for the same reason they have forever, right? They're looking for - they're looking to belong. They're looking for guidance. They're looking for social status. They're looking for finance. It goes on and on and on. And so when you take a vulnerable population - a child comes here. They have no parents. They have no guidance. They have no supervision. They're unskilled, uneducated. They don't speak the language. They are prime candidates to be recruited for gangs. I know that. I've worked it. That's what I meant - I was trying to say. SHAPIRO: Let me ask broadly about the culture of the organization you lead. Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner in charge of the Office of Professional Responsibility, told reporters on Monday that his office is investigating at least 62 current Border Patrol agents who belong to this secret Facebook group we've been hearing about. ProPublica published screenshots that included obscene images and threats to Democrats in Congress. What are you doing about the sense within your organization that it is acceptable to mock and denigrate and dehumanize people who have crossed the border illegally? MORGAN: So I'm glad you asked that - and two things. So let me start off by saying it was horrendous, all right? Some of the images were out there - absolutely horrendous, wrong and not consistent with the way that CBP, or specifically Border Patrol, conducts themselves - period. What I would say is that it also, though, does not represent the culture of the Border Patrol. I've seen just the opposite. I've seen Border Patrol agents out there treating these - some of these same kids we're talking about, right? SHAPIRO: I appreciate that you've seen that; we've also seen images that show a different side of the culture. So my question is, what are you doing to eradicate the side of the culture that is less pleasant than what you're describing? MORGAN: So I think part of it is - we're coming on shows just like this - right? - and talking about it and saying that it's unacceptable, unequivocally. I think everybody needs to hear it from the commissioner, acting commissioner of CBP, that those posts are absolutely unacceptable. It's wrong. And we are going to fully investigate that. You know, I know - Matt has already reported to me, and he's keeping me up to date daily, by the way. SHAPIRO: That's Matt Klein, the assistant commissioner in charge of the Office of Professional Responsibility that I mentioned, yeah. MORGAN: Right. Kind of - internal affairs, just in case people don't understand that. So he's actually providing me daily updates. And he's expediting that. We've got a team together. We're fully investigating that. And we're going to hold these people responsible to include - I mean, we're actually looking at potential criminal charges. Now, I don't know whether the actions will satisfy the elements of criminal charges, but that has been talked about, just to show how serious we're taking that. We've already put several people on administrative leave, which, by the way, that's a huge deal. We're taking them off their law enforcement duties. They lose pay. We've already done that. We've given numerous cease-and-desist letters as well. And I can promise American people we're going to hold them accountable. SHAPIRO: We're in this funny situation right now where you have been in this acting capacity, in this job for two weeks, having been in acting capacity in a different job for about a month. Your boss, in an acting capacity, is testifying on Capitol Hill. Almost all of the leaders at Homeland Security are acting, and it is one of the highest priorities of this administration. So how do you implement a coherent border policy under those circumstances? MORGAN: Acting - so the only people that are really concerned about acting are people like you. SHAPIRO: Well, and presumably the big guys at the White House who have to work with the people in their cabinet who are a rotating cast of characters. MORGAN: So nobody that I've worked with, with the White House or the secretary or anybody else, has ever worried about whether acting is in front of our name or not. I don't wake up in the morning changing anything I do because I have acting in front of my name. SHAPIRO: There has been more turnover in the Department of Homeland Security in this administration than at any time in my memory. That's got to have an impact. MORGAN: I think that, yeah, anytime you have a turnover, there's some impact. I agree. I think that's reasonable to say. But you got to remember - the men and women of CBP, whether I'm here tomorrow or I'm here for two years, what they do every single day, they're going to keep doing it. SHAPIRO: Mark Morgan is the Trump administration's acting head of Customs and Border Protection. Thank you for coming into the studio today. MORGAN: You bet, Ari. Thank you for having me.

Planned Parenthood now says it clinics nationwide will stop using federal Title X family planning funds. Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide have stopped using federal Title X family planning funds, according to the organization. The decision comes after the Trump administration announced this week that it has started enforcing regulations that prohibit Title X grant recipients from counseling patients about abortion. The Trump administration's rules \u2013 unveiled last year and finalized this year \u2013 forbid groups that provide or refer patients for abortion from receiving funds through Title X, which pays for reproductive health care for about 4 million low-income people. After a recent series of legal challenges left the rule in place \u2013 at least for now \u2013 the administration said on Monday that it would begin enforcing the rules. In a statement, Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations & public policy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the organization is refusing to comply with what critics call a \"gag rule\" and instead has stopped using Title X dollars. \"It is unethical and dangerous to require health care providers to withhold important information from patients,\" Ayers' statement said. \"During this period of limbo while we wait for the court to rule, our affiliates are not using federal Title X funds to provide care. We are continuing to fight this illegal rule in court and to provide care to all people \u2014 no matter what.\" Planned Parenthood says it will dip into emergency funds to continuing providing care. Officials say about 40% of Title X recipients nationwide receive health services at the group's clinics. This comes at a time of uncertainty for the organization. Earlier this week, Planned Parenthood's board announced it had replaced President Dr. Leana Wen with an interim leader. Wen said she was fired after a \"secret\" meeting over philosophical differences. On Tuesday, Maine Family Planning announced it would stop accepting Title X dollars after nearly five decades as a grantee. The organization operates 18 of its own clinics and sub-contracts with other health centers around the state to provide reproductive health services through the federal program. We announced today that, after nearly 50 years as Maine\u2019s #TitleX grantee, we will withdraw from the program rather than comply with the Trump-Pence #GagRule. We won't compromise on care or medical ethics. Our clinics are open and we are providing services just as we always have. pic.twitter.com/FWceSNegJj President and CEO George Hill said in an interview with NPR that at least 25% of the organization's funding comes from Title X, and a total of 50 sites across Maine could be affected by the rule. \"Our doors are gonna remain open ... It's gonna be an enormous challenge to replace these dollars, but we simply can't accept them,\" Hill said. Hill said Maine Family Planning provides abortions using private funds. For other services normally funded by Title X, Hill said the group will tap into reserves and explore other potential funding sources. \"This rule is so onerous and arrogant that we simply cannot accept the federal funds with these limitations on them and provide what we believe is the full range of reproductive healthcare services that our patients deserve,\" Hill said. Reproductive rights groups have seen the regulations as a major blow, and have said the rules will interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. The president's supporters see them as a fulfillment of his campaign promise to \"defund\" Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortion is already illegal except in a few circumstances, but the new regulations mean many organizations that once provided other reproductive health services through Title X are now barred from receiving those funds. In a statement this week praising the Trump administration's announcement that it will begin enforcement of the rule,Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, praised administration officials for \"acting decisively to stop taxpayer funding of the abortion industry.\" Reproductive rights groups say they'll continue to fight the rule in court.

        "texts": "Susan Phillips Flames and smoke emerge from the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in Philadelphia on June 21. Experts say the explosions could have been far more devastating if deadly hydrogen fluoride had been released. Matt Rourke/AP hide caption Flames and smoke emerge from the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in Philadelphia on June 21. Experts say the explosions could have been far more devastating if deadly hydrogen fluoride had been released. In the predawn hours of June 21, explosions at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in South Philadelphia shook houses, sent fireballs into the air and woke up nearby residents. \"Three loud explosions, one after the other, boom, boom boom!\" says David Masur, who lives about two miles from the plant and has two young kids. \"It's a little nerve-wracking.\" Masur watched as the refinery spewed black smoke above the city, easily visible from his home. But what he didn't know at the time was just how close he and his family came to getting exposed to hydrogen fluoride, one of the deadliest chemicals used by refiners and other industrial manufacturers. Philadelphia Energy Solutions knows that's a possibility. Its worst-case disaster scenario includes 143,262 pounds of hydrogen fluoride released over 10 minutes, which could travel as a toxic cloud for more than 7 miles and impact more than a million people, including in schools, homes, hospitals, prisons, playgrounds, parks and a wildlife sanctuary. City, state and federal officials say none of the air monitors in or around the refinery \u2014 or the air samples collected by the city's health department \u2014 detected the chemical, often referred to as HF. And a spokeswoman for Philadelphia Energy Solutions says no workers were exposed. The explosion destroyed the refinery's alkylation unit, where crude oil is converted to high octane gas, and led to the planned closure of the financially troubled plant. But two other refineries in the Philadelphia region also use HF, as do some four dozen around the country. The Philadelphia explosions, along with similar accidents in the past four years, are reviving concerns about inadequate safety measures and calls to end the use of the deadly chemical. A string of 'near misses' A 2013 report released by the United Steelworkers, the union that represents refinery workers, warned that facilities using HF don't have adequate safety measures in place and are unprepared for a release. It said this puts 12,000 workers and 13 million residents at risk of exposure, including in major metropolitan areas like Houston, Memphis and Salt Lake City. It also pointed to 131 \"HF-related incidents or near misses\" in the three years preceding the publication of the report and called for phasing out the use of hydrogen fluoride. For those who know deeply about the dangers of HF, the news of the PES refinery explosion struck a terrifying chord that echoed beyond the clouds of black smoke visible to TV viewers nationwide. \"Don't look at it and say, 'Man, a nuclear bomb went off and nothing was released, so that must mean it's safe,'\" says engineer and activist Sally Hayati. \"No, that just means the fortuitous outcome of this just happened to be such that it wasn't released. You could have had tens of thousands of people die.\" Hayati lives near a refinery in suburban Los Angeles and is active with the Torrance Refinery Action Alliance. In 2015, at what was then the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, an explosion sent an 80,000 pound piece of equipment flying and it landed just a few feet from a tank full of HF. Hayati says a release of HF from the Torrance facility, like the refineries in the Philadelphia area, would be difficult to flee. \"There's no place to evacuate to, and there would be no time,\" she says. The Chemical Safety Board, an independent federal agency that investigated the incident in Torrance, criticized ExxonMobil's outdated equipment and poor safety procedures. ExxonMobil said it followed \"stringent safety measures,\" and there was no evidence that the explosion posed a risk to the community. The refinery is now owned by PBF Energy. Hayati says her group is pushing to ban HF, but industry opposes the effort. People should never have been allowed to live this close to these refineries. It's just unconscionable to have allowed that to happen. Ron Koopman, physicist and chemical safety expert A toxic cloud at a Nevada test site The definitive experiment on the release of hydrofluoric acid was done back in 1986, and it did not go well. The oil company Amoco requested the test. It was building a refinery in Texas and hoping to use a system of ponds to help mitigate any leaks of hydrogen fluoride. Ron Koopman conducted the experiment. He's a physicist and expert on chemical safety, and worked as a researcher at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for 36 years. He says when about 1,000 gallons of HF were released in the Nevada desert test site, the results were shocking. The HF turned into an expanding vapor cloud. A terrifying video of the experiment shows white billowing clouds of the toxin getting larger and moving rapidly along the ground. Koopman says deadly concentrations of HF traveled for miles. \"How many times do we try this before we actually get a release that kills 1,000 people?\" Koopman said in an interview with NPR. \"People should never have been allowed to live this close to these refineries. It's just unconscionable to have allowed that to happen.\" Koopman says those exposed to HF die a horrible death. The chemical penetrates the skin and reacts with calcium in bones. Swallowing just a small amount, or getting small splashes on the skin, can be fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In its gaseous state, the CDC says low levels can irritate the eyes, nose and respiratory tract. Breathing it at high levels \"can cause death from an irregular heartbeat or fluid buildup in the lungs.\" The best way to mitigate an HF release is to spray water on it. The PES refinery also employed a safety system that quickly drained an impacted tank of HF into an emergency vessel that was on standby. A worker at the plant told The Philadelphia Inquirer that's what saved the surrounding community from potentially deadly impacts. Koopman says so far, it's pure luck that there haven't been more fatalities from HF releases. He thinks that's because most of the releases were caused by explosions or fires, which force the HF above ground level, where it can mix with air and reduce the hazard. In such a case, Koopman says, it's possible HF could be released but not measured by any monitors near the ground. Questions about risk management plans The Environmental Protection Agency requires refineries to file worst-case scenarios for the release of toxic chemicals as part of their risk management plans. But it's not easy for nearby residents to find out what they are. The plans are technically public information but are only available to view at 10 regional EPA offices across the country (including one in Philadelphia), and the agency does not allow the plans to be photocopied. Just two months before the South Philadelphia explosion, the Chemical Safety Board, an independent federal agency that has authority to investigate industrial accidents, urged the EPA to review its risk management plans and consider if they are sufficient. The EPA's last study of them was in 1993. The letter referenced the 2015 Torrance, Calif., explosion, as well as a 2018 explosion and fire at the Husky refinery in Superior, Wis. In that case, debris did not hit the HF storage tanks, but it did puncture a nearby asphalt storage tank. Eleven refinery and contract workers were injured, and parts of the town were evacuated for fear of an HF release. The mayor of Superior and the mayor of nearby Duluth, Minn., have called on the refinery to stop using HF. Refinery owners point out that of the HF used nationwide, only 2-4% is used in alkylation units. But Daniel Horowitz, a former managing director at the Chemical Safety Board, says the other uses \u2014 including in refrigeration and electronics manufacturing\u2014 don't store as much HF on site, and they're not in such close proximity to highly flammable hydrocarbons. The Obama administration boosted protections around the accidental release of toxic chemicals and emergency response. President Trump's EPA tried to delay that, and then in 2018 proposed rolling back some parts of the rule, including the requirement for industry to assess safer alternatives. Possible alternatives The industry defends its use of hydrogen fluoride. The American Petroleum Institute says HF has been used safely since World War II, with minimum off-site impacts and no off-site fatalities. API spokesman Scott Lauermann says the industry's top priority is protecting the health and safety of employees and communities. \"In addition to oversight from multiple government agencies, refineries also adhere to strict operational standards designed to further mitigate risk and assure safe operations,\" he said in a statement. About 50 refineries across the country do not use HF in their alkylation units, but instead use sulfuric acid. That's considered safer because if released, it will pool as a liquid at ground level. But it's expensive for refineries to convert from HF to sulfuric acid. The chemical company Honeywell says its \"plant design, operating practices and safety equipment\" also promote the safe use of hydrogen fluoride. But Honeywell is also developing another possible alternative to HF, which it calls ISOALKY, that could be used in newly built refineries. A Chinese company recently announced it would use it. One advantage, according to Honeywell, is that the ionic liquid catalyst has zero vapor pressure, so a leak would result in the liquid simply pooling on the ground. Ongoing investigations Several state and federal agencies continue to investigate what happened at the Philadelphia refinery, but the results could take months. Kristen Kulinowski, the Chemical Safety Board's interim executive authority, says the board will also investigate. It wants to know whether \"there was a potential for release of HF,\" she says, \"and the changes that need to happen to prevent this from happening again.\" For nearby residents like David Masur, it was a wake-up call. Some people got a text message from the city's emergency management office telling them to shelter in place, but Masur says he lives two blocks too far from the plant for that warning. He's not sure huddling in the basement with duct tape on \"every single crack or crevice\" is the best option. But he's also not sure about the alternative. \"It's 4 a.m.,\" he says. \"What do I do? Drive with a million other people over the Walt Whitman bridge?\" NPR's Rebecca Hersher contributed to this story.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Should Republicans still call themselves the Party of Lincoln? Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, declared, \"We are the party of Lincoln,\" as he contended President Trump was not racist for suggesting four Democratic representatives, US citizens who are also women of color, should \"go back\" to the places they came from. But it might be telling to remember what Abraham Lincoln thought of a political movement of the 1850's called the American Party. They called themselves the Know Nothings, because they were encouraged to say they \"knew nothing\" about the secretive party's membership. The Know Nothings detested and feared immigration. They believed an influx of Catholic immigrants - from Germany and Ireland - were part of a papal conspiracy to overthrow white Protestant America. They wanted to restrict immigration, and keep foreign-born citizens from voting. The Know Nothings were not a negligible splinter group. They won more than forty seats in congress in 1854. Millard Fillmore, their candidate for president in 1856, won 21% of the vote. Lincoln wrote his old friend, Joshua Speed, in 1855, \"I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can anyone who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that 'all men are created equal.' We now practically read it 'all men are created equal, except negroes.' When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read 'all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.'\" Lincoln, like many great figures, can be quoted to bolster almost any position. But Sean Trainor, a lecturer at the University of Florida who has written about the period, told us, \"Modern Republican immigration policy bears no resemblance to the policies of Lincoln and his generation of Republicans. The party's founders fought against proposed limits on the number of immigrant arrivals ...Today's Republicans do the opposite.\" Maybe no political party can forever be identified with its founders. Many Democrats no longer call their annual fund-raisers, \"Jefferson-Jackson Dinners,\" because Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"all men are created equal,\" but still owned slaves, and Andrew Jackson brutalized Native Americans. But can Republicans who don't see bigotry in President Trump's insult continue to claim Abe Lincoln as the brand name of their party?

Shuran Huang/NPR hide caption Acting Chief of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan says he doesn't expect the asylum rule announced this week to be in place for very long. Updated July 19 at 12:25 p.m. ET Mark Morgan, acting head of Customs and Border Protection, said on Thursday that his agency is rolling out the Trump administration's new asylum rule as a small \"pilot\" for now but that officials expect it to be blocked in court. The rule is a major change in U.S. asylum law. It effectively denies asylum protection to most migrants arriving at the Southern border unless they first apply in a country they passed through on the way. \"Although the new federal regulation allows us to apply that all 2,000 miles along the Southwest border, we're not going to do that. We're really piloting it in just one location,\" Morgan said during an interview on All Things Considered. In a statement on Friday, Morgan said that he was not referring to implementation of the new rule \"as a whole.\" He said the rule applies to all migrants who didn't previously apply for asylum in another country but for now his agency is only putting it into place in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas at two CBP stations. \"That location is briefed, and they know what to do and how to do that now,\" he said. \"It's very limited,\" he said. Morgan said he doesn't expect the policy to be in place for long. \"We're actually anticipating the ... regulation will be enjoined. And then we'll have to go from there, as unfortunately, many times, this happens,\" Morgan said. Two federal lawsuits that have been filed in California and Washington, D.C. Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigrant rights project said the administration hadn't presented the rule as limited in court where the rule is being challenged. \"It may be that the government is backtracking given the plain illegality of the rule. But whether it applies across the southern border or only in two places, it will cause serious harm and we will continue to challenge the new rule,\" Gelernt said. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, whose officers interview asylum seekers, did not respond to requests for comment. That agency issued guidance earlier this week, saying the rule applies to migrants who cross the southern border and took effect Tuesday. Morgan, who has been on the job for two weeks after spending just a month as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also addressed an internal CBP investigation into a private Border Patrol Facebook group that circulated obscene images of Democrats in Congress and ridiculed people who have crossed the border illegally. \"It was horrendous,\" Morgan said. \"Some of the images that were out there, absolutely horrendous, wrong and not consistent with the way CBP, or specifically, Border Patrol conducts themselves.\" \"We're going to hold these people responsible,\" Morgan said, adding that offenders could face criminal charges. \"I don't know whether the actions will satisfy any of the elements of criminal charges, but that has been talked about just to show how serious we're taking that,\" Morgan said. Nearly all high-level immigration officials at the Department of Homeland Security are serving in an acting capacity. Morgan acknowledged \"that any time you have turnover, there is some impact.\" But he said it doesn't affect his job. \"We do the same job, we have the same authority, same responsibilities whether acting is in front of our name or not. I don't wake up the morning changing anything I do because I have 'acting' in front of my name,\" he said. On Thursday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan testified to Congress that there has been a 28% drop in the number of migrants taken into custody at the Southern border in the last month. Morgan credited Mexico for helping to slow the flow of migrants. \"The support that they've shown now in the recent couple of weeks is unprecedented. And we're seeing it there. They're ... tightening up their Southern border. They're sending more troops to the U.S. Mexico border. And it's definitely having an impact,\" Morgan said.

        "texts": "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NEIL ARMSTRONG: Out of detent. Auto. BUZZ ALDRIN: Mode control, both auto. Descent engine command override, off. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Fifty years ago today, human beings landed on the moon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLES DUKE: We copy you down, Eagle. ARMSTRONG: Houston... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Unintelligible). ARMSTRONG: ...Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. SIMON: Six and a half hours later, 9:56 p.m. in Houston, 4:56 a.m. in Paris, 10:56 a.m. in Beijing... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ARMSTRONG: OK, I'm going to step off the LEM now. SIMON: ...Neil Armstrong stood in the bottom rung at the Lunar Excursion Module to step into history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ARMSTRONG: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. SIMON: We asked a man who helped get there what people of a certain age are asked all the time. Where were you when man landed on the moon? MICHAEL COLLINS: You know, I really don't know. I was in an orbit... SIMON: (Laughter). COLLINS: ...That went around the moon at 15 miles. So sometimes I was over where I could see the dinky little Earth, and sometimes I was over behind the moon. I don't know where I was when they landed - tell you the truth. SIMON: Michael Collins. His name is on the plaque Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left on the surface of the moon. But he's the man they left behind in orbit in command of their Apollo 11 spacecraft. As they landed on the moon, he circled it, often on the far side, where radio waves were blocked. He was on his own, left to circle a moon that was desolate, save for the two humans he often couldn't hear. Commentators at the time said no other human being in history, or at least since Adam, had ever been so profoundly alone. Michael Collins says he grew tired of being asked. COLLINS: Weren't you the loneliest person in the whole lonely history of the lonely Earth and in lonely orbit behind the back of the lonely Earth? Weren't you lonely? And I thought, no, not in any way, shape or form. SIMON: (Laughter). COLLINS: I mean, loneliness - some people are loneliest - lonely for a lifetime or a month or a year. I mean, for eight days to and from, I don't think loneliness really comes into the equation, except it seemed to in the minds of the press at the time. SIMON: What did we learn by landing on the moon? COLLINS: Well, we learned, for one thing, how to overcome the gravity of the Earth so that if we wanted to go elsewhere, we were capable of doing it. And that is - I think is a wonderfully valuable thing for mankind to have, whether you land on the moon or whether you go elsewhere. So first, it was that. And second, I thought, from a human point of view, it was a very unusual undertaking in that - well, after the flight, for example, Neil, Buzz and I were visiting about 29 different cities around the world. Everywhere we went, people said we did it. We, humanity, we left this dinky little planet, and we went elsewhere. And I don't know of any event before or since that's had that kind of unanimity. And I think that's a wonderful contribution that Apollo did make for a little while. Under its limited circumstances, everyone everywhere seemed united behind what we had done. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COLLINS: Neil and Buzz, the president of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you, over. SIMON: President Nixon spoke to the two astronauts who took halting, bouncing steps on the surface of another world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD NIXON: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. SIMON: Do you wish you'd been able to walk on the moon? COLLINS: Absolutely, yes. Am I dissatisfied with the part that I played? Absolutely not. And so I had it both ways, really. SIMON: Do you ever look up at the moon nowadays? COLLINS: Not on purpose, no. I'll be walking down, shuffling down the sidewalk after dark. And all of a sudden, I'll kind of look up and go, whoa. SIMON: (Laughter). COLLINS: Oh, I went there one time. SIMON: (Laughter). COLLINS: You know, I mean, it sort of takes me by surprise. SIMON: Michael Collins is 88 now, still charming and vigorous and often wry. He says the real revelation of the mission for him was less to behold the moon but our own blue home in the dark of the solar system. COLLINS: I usually get asked what the moon looked like up close, and that's an interesting question with a lot of good answers. But to me, even though I was sitting on its front doorstep, to me, the moon was nothing compared to the Earth. The Earth was it - it was the whole show. SIMON: Yeah. COLLINS: Even though it was only, you know, about the size of your thumbnail, you could move your thumb out of the way, but it kind of kept inching its way back into your presence, as if it wanted to be looked at and seen and... SIMON: Wow. COLLINS: ...Understood. And the first thing, of course, is it's just tiny - tiny against a black velvet background, which makes it look more prominent. You get the very bright colors of the blue of the ocean, the white of the clouds... SIMON: Yeah. COLLINS: ...And the smear of rust that we call continents. Put all that together, and it's just a glorious thing. You could just sit and watch it all day long... SIMON: Wow. COLLINS: ...Out your window. I could just have spent day after day, week after week looking at the tiny little Earth. SIMON: Michael Collins left the space program after his mission around the moon. He wrote a best-selling memoir, became an assistant secretary of state for public affairs and then director of the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum. He did something historic, bold and dangerous for his country and the world. I get one last question. COLLINS: OK. SIMON: Why should we go into space? COLLINS: Why? SIMON: Yeah. COLLINS: When someone asks me why we should go into space, I desert the world of facts and figures and come down on a world of emotions. When I was a kid, I just liked to lie on my back on the night grass and look up and see what I could see. Most of it I couldn't understand. That made it all the more intriguing. But to have that around me, I guess I could turn that over and say I don't want to live with a lid over my head. I would like that lid to be removed. I would like to have the possibilities that - exist there in that third dimension, and that we have the possibility now of visiting a lot of them. That's why we should go into space, I believe. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN KING SONG, \"EVERYONE'S GONE TO THE MOON\") SIMON: God bless you. What an honor to talk to you, Michael Collins. COLLINS: Thank you very much.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, a veteran of 34 years on the U.S. Supreme Court, has died. He was 99. Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford. And while he was once viewed as moderately conservative, he eventually earned a reputation as the most liberal justice on a court dramatically more conservative than the one he joined in 1975. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: John Paul Stevens, often called a judge's judge, was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, law and politics were a noble pursuit not a blood sport. The quintessential Midwesterner Stevens was born in Chicago, educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and, later, appeals court judge. In 1975, President Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. And Stevens, wearing his trademark bow tie, was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. Given his lack of political ties, Stevens' rise was, to some extent, a fluke, according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan. CLIFFORD SLOAN: It was an accident of history, and the stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment. TOTENBERG: A brand-new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. And with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also picked for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism. Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence. Over time, he was seen as an increasingly respected and influential justice, a man beloved by his colleagues for his decency, his unassuming nature and his tough inner core. In his first decade, he was viewed as a center-right justice. But as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member - a moniker he never liked. Indeed, Stevens said forthrightly in 2010 that it wasn't he who changed. Rather, it was a court populated by new justices with a conservative ideology that Stevens saw as quite radical. Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to obscenity, from school prayer to campaign finance reform, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. TOTENBERG: As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED OLSON: The crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident. TOTENBERG: The decisions Stevens will likely be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-3 decision repudiating President Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004, he authored the court's 6-3 decision, allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones; the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN PAUL STEVENS: In the entire history of the republic, only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. As for the case at hand, there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly after discovery is concluded. TOTENBERG: Critics thought Stevens' view naive - the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And, indeed, as it turned out, Paula Jones' case led directly to the impeachment of President Clinton. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system; that no person is above the law. While Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together, under one legal tent, justices one might not expect to agree, he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens, the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star, objected, declaring that the value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, when the court majority ruled that a key section of the Brady gun-control law unconstitutionally conscripted local law enforcement to conduct background checks on gun buyers, Stevens took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties. Since the ultimate issue is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency - matters such as the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic or, perhaps, the threat of an international terrorist. TOTENBERG: Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later, when he managed to eke out a 5-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program. TOTENBERG: Stevens' angriest dissent came, without doubt, in Bush v. Gore. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner in this year's presidential election, he wrote, the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law. Two other dissents were barn burners as well. His 2008 dissent, when a five-justice majority struck down a local ban on handguns, ruling for the first time that there's a constitutional right for individuals to own a gun - and his 2010 dissent, when the same five-justice majority struck down a century-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections. Stevens' oral dissent in the campaign finance case, provided here by the Oyez Project, was passionate and long. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Simply put, corporations are not human beings. In the context of an election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Corporations cannot vote or run for office. Because they're managed (ph) and controlled by non-residents, their interests may conflict in fundamental ways with the interests of eligible voters. The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporate speakers exactly like human beings in the political realm represents a radical change in the law. TOTENBERG: Behind the scenes, Stevens was often a persuasive and strategic thinker. In 1992, for instance, he played a pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. The court was split into three separate factions - four justices to reverse Roe outright, three to uphold its core but allow more regulation by the states and two, including Stevens and Harry Blackmun, to uphold Roe entirely. Upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it, and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority of 5. The three quickly agreed, and the opinion became the law of the land. In a 2010 NPR interview, Stevens said that in his three and a half decades on the court, he really had just one regret. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEVENS: I think there is one vote that I would change. And that's one - was upholding the Texas capital punishment statute. TOTENBERG: He cast that vote in 1976, at a time when, he noted, the court had adopted many rules to limit the death penalty to a narrow category of offenders and to prevent what he called loading the dice for the prosecution. But over time, those limiting rules were abandoned. And so in his later years, Stevens opposed most death sentences, winning rare but important victories, as when he wrote the court's opinion striking down capital punishment for the, quote, \"mentally retarded.\" He maintained he was undecided about retiring. But in late June of 2010, his lengthy dissent in the campaign finance case was marred by verbal flubs. He was so distressed by his performance that he sought a complete checkup by his doctor. There was nothing wrong. But not long thereafter, Stevens announced his retirement. In the years afterwards, he continued to be both physically and intellectually active, playing tennis and golf, writing articles and books and speaking about the court and its work. When he thought the court in error, he lobbed critiques, as always, pointed, literate and respectful. The very qualities that made him such a revered figure in the law. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. KELLY: And the news again for those of you just joining us - retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens died this evening at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The cause was complications following a stroke. And Nina Totenberg is here with us live. Hey there, Nina. TOTENBERG: Hi there, Mary Louise. KELLY: Hey. My main question for you, as somebody who's covered the court for so many years - tell me your best Justice Stevens story. How will you remember him? TOTENBERG: I will always remember him as such a gentleman, that when he would ask a question - and he asked very good questions - he would say something on the order of, excuse me, counsel. Forgive me. Maybe I'm not quite understanding you, but - and then he would ask this question that would go to the heart of the case. And the lawyer would be left standing there sort of gawking, going, what do I do with this? But he was never impolite. He was always kind. He really... KELLY: Yeah. TOTENBERG: ...Was a beloved figure. KELLY: Yeah. That is NPR's Nina Totenberg, remembering John Paul Stevens, who served 34 years on the U.S. Supreme Court. He died tonight. He was 99 years old.

        "title": "Steve Bullock, Montana Governor And 2020 Candidate, Vows To Tackle 'Dark Money' : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: Montana Governor Steve Bullock started his presidential campaign late, and so he missed the first Democratic primary debate. His campaign says he's qualified for the next round later this month. Now, at the center of his campaign is dark money. In the latest installment of MORNING EDITION's Opening Arguments series, our policy conversations with 2020 candidates, Bullock says he thinks anonymous money from corporations and lobbying groups has corrupted our democratic process. And he started with an example. STEVE BULLOCK: Think about the first George Bush. George H.W. Bush said we will lead on climate change, and we'll lead from the top. That was 30 years ago. And now Republicans can't even acknowledge that climate change is human caused or real because of the outside spending in our elections. If we can't take care of the corrupting influence of money in our elections, everything else that the Democrats are talking about, we're going to run into the same problem. KING: Can I just ask what reforms you would make specifically on dark money? Like, what are your plans? BULLOCK: So Day 1, I'd sign an executive order that says if you want a contract with the federal government I can't tell you, you can't spend or donate, but you have to disclose every single dollar that you are either spending are donating to influence our elections. Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference. My legislature was about two-thirds Republican when we passed a bill that said 90 days out from election, you have to disclose every nickel that you spend. Never forget, when I was running for reelection, Day 90, all of that dark money spending stopped. And if we could kick the Koch brothers or other groups out of Montana, we ought to be able do it everywhere in the country. KING: Let's turn to foreign policy, which is something that, as a governor, you haven't had a tremendous amount of experience with. Would you end U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen? BULLOCK: I would. What's happened in Yemen has been failed from the beginning. So I think that we actually need to actually be withdrawing the U.S. dollars but try to bring the U.N. in together for more of a peacekeeping role. KING: Would you withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan? BULLOCK: I would want to make sure that we are completely out by the end of my first term. KING: 2024? BULLOCK: 2024. KING: You are one of just four Democratic candidates in a very large field not to pledge that you will not take money from the fossil fuel industry. Why not? BULLOCK: Well, I've - and look, the overall efforts in trying to make sure that all money's disclosed has been the fight of my career. And what I've said from the beginning is I'll disclose every single dollar that's donated to my campaign with full transparency. No PAC money. No corporate money. But haven't said this industry or that industry. We just won't accept dollars. KING: But why not? BULLOCK: To be candid, I don't even know if I've gotten one nickel from anybody in the fossil fuel industry. We could certainly check and get back to you. But it's just - if it's an individual giving a donation, I'm not going to put these lines around, here's who's worthy to give and who's worthy not to give. And I also think that there's something about this, too. Like, you know, Montana's a coal state. KING: Yeah. BULLOCK: We have to take immediate and durable action on climate change. But I think at times, Democrats will turn around and say - you know, folks, this example that it powered this country for their whole lives and worked hard - at times, there's a perception that Democrats think something's wrong with those individuals. So I think that we have to be careful, especially the workers, that we're not demonizing what they've chosen to do to actually feed their family. But we're trying to make this transition fast. KING: You said we should rejoin the Paris climate deal. We should note that even if the signatories to that deal meet their goals, which they're not on track to do, global temperatures will still rise over what scientists refer to as the threshold of catastrophe. What else will you do to make sure that doesn't happen? BULLOCK: You bet. And the scientists say we have to be net-zero emissions, carbon neutral, as a world by 2050. I think we could do it by 2040, or even earlier. KING: If you were the president, how? What's your plan? BULLOCK: We need to make federal investments in everything from those opportunities upgrading the grid to investing in agriculture. There's sustainable agriculture, and the Dairy Council's examples, already saying here's how they can be net-zero emissions. We can't do this alone. As you know, China emits twice as much as we do. We know that we have to take about a billion tons of CO2 out a year if we're going to actually meet these targets. And I think bringing together everybody from conservationists, to labor to utilities and say let's actually make this track an opportunity. KING: You are an interesting candidate in a very specific way. You're a politician whose mind has changed on a very real topic, which is gun control. You used to not support a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. But you changed your mind, and now you do. What year did you change your mind? BULLOCK: '17 or '18 is when I said universal background checks. It was just last year on assault weapons. KING: That puts you behind a lot of the country, though. And I wonder why that is? BULLOCK: Yeah. KING: Why'd it take you so long? BULLOCK: So we had a \"March For Our Lives\" in Helena, in Montana. I was asked to speak and supposed to speak. I went with my children, and I listened. And as these kids are saying, enough. That's where I finally said, enough with the assault weapons. Because I know as a gun owner. I know that it's not for hunting. I know it's not for self-defense. There's no reason to continue to sell these. KING: When you talk about dark money, you talk about how Americans are supposed to count equally and that dark money sort of perverts that. There is a norm that you are very clearly seeking to return to in the United States. But I wonder, what do you think American democracy looks like in the wake of the Trump presidency? Are there norms to return to, or has this country changed forever? BULLOCK: There has to be. I mean, I think that we are at a tenuous time in this 243-year experiment called representative democracy. And that's one of the reasons why I got into this because I think that things fundamentally change if this guy is reelected. The norms and expectations, and the behavior that's been normalized, and the lies and the misstatements that divide us by race, by gender, by geography, I think that there are norms to be returned to. And I think that we've got to make sure that people know that they're as important as any corporation on Election Day, and every one of us have the same amount of influence over elections. That's how we make sure that the norms are restored, that people feel like that they have a role and a voice in this representative democracy. KING: Montana Governor Steve Bullock, thanks so much. BULLOCK: Thank you so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

        "texts": "Ryan Lucas Roger Stone apologized to Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over his case, after criticizing her on Instagram. In court Thursday, Stone will learn what Jackson makes of his actions. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Roger Stone is a brash, self-declared dirty trickster known for speaking his mind. Now federal judge Amy Berman Jackson has barred the Trump confidant from speaking publicly at all about his legal case. Stone has been charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas was in court today, and he is in the studio now. Hi, Ryan. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: It is never dull when Roger Stone is in court, and it sounds like today was kind of a wild scene. Tell us about it. LUCAS: It was. There was a long line at the courthouse to get into this hearing. The courtroom itself, of course, was packed. Stone strolled in. He was wearing a double-breasted suit, blue tie, pocket square, kind of how he usually looks. And then the hearing opens, and the defense drops this big surprise. It says, we are going to call Roger Stone to take the stand to testify. There was a ripple of shock through the courtroom. Journalists, members of the public, even the judge seemed a bit surprised by this decision. Stone walked to the witness stand, raised his right hand, took the oath. And in many ways, things kind of went downhill for Stone from there. He was questioned by his attorney first but then grilled by Judge Jackson and cross-examined by the government. SHAPIRO: And remind us what this specific hearing was about today. LUCAS: Well, this all stems from a photograph of the presiding judge, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, that Stone posted to his Instagram account earlier this week. The caption to the photo attacked the special counsel's Russia investigation, really criticized the judge as well, included the hashtag #fixisin. But the biggest issue was that in the upper left hand corner of the photograph was what looked like crosshairs to a gun. That raised questions about whether this was some sort of threat against the judge. Stone took the photo down after he posted it, but Jackson was not amused. She called today's hearing to have him come in and explain what was going on. SHAPIRO: And what did each side want out of this today? LUCAS: Well, the government wanted restrictions placed on Stone and his public statements. They argued that the post was an attack on the proceedings. It was an attempt to sway public opinion about the investigation and the case. And they said that it could taint the jury pool. Stone's defense team, on the other hand, they asked for a second chance. They said, please do not impose a gag order on Stone himself. Stone, when he was on the stand, said that he'd learned his lesson, said it was a momentary lapse in judgment, promised that it wouldn't happen again. Now, prosecutors and Judge Jackson really dug into Stone about that. They asked - you know, he was - talked about this apology that he filed immediately with the court. If he was sincere with that, they asked, why would he be on TV afterwards defending the photograph, saying that the uproar over it was just the media making him a target? Stone struggled answer that. SHAPIRO: OK. So maybe he wasn't the most compelling witness. At the end of the day, the judge has barred him from talking about this case or anyone involved when he posts on social media or goes on TV. If he happens to violate that gag order, what happens then? LUCAS: Well, throughout this whole hearing, Jackson made quite clear that she was not happy with the post. She made clear that she did not find what she called his evolving explanation over what happened convincing. She concluded that he would be a danger to others if she didn't impose restrictions. And then she told Stone that if he does not follow the terms of this gag order, she would, quote, \"be compelled to adjust your environment.\" Now, she spelled it out so that it was absolutely clear what that meant. If he violates this, she will revoke his bond and lock him up pending trial. SHAPIRO: He is always - well, he's not exactly a humble person. How did he take that? LUCAS: Well, you know, Stone looked kind of contrite throughout this whole hearing. But again, he's someone who has a history of speaking out. It will be interesting to see whether he can live by this gag order. SHAPIRO: NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas. Thank you. LUCAS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

The former campaign adviser for President Trump has been forbidden to speak publicly about his case. Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption Roger Stone, accompanied by his wife, Nydia, arrives at federal court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. The former campaign adviser for President Trump has been forbidden to speak publicly about his case. Updated at 6:34 p.m. ET A federal judge on Thursday barred Roger Stone from talking publicly about his case after an inflammatory photo was posted on his Instagram account of the judge that included what appeared to be a crosshairs. Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected apologies offered by Stone, both in writing and in person at a hearing in Washington, D.C. If Stone violates the order, Jackson warned him, she would be \"compelled to adjust your environment.\" She then spelled out what that meant \u2014 she would revoke his bond and order him to be detained ahead of his trial. The judge's decision adds Stone to an existing gag order that prohibits attorneys from speaking about the case and bars any of the parties from talking about it in the vicinity of the courthouse. Stone, 66, has been charged with obstruction, false statements and witness tampering as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The obstruction and false statements charges relate to testimony he gave to Congress about the role he allegedly played in 2016 as an intermediary between Donald Trump's campaign and WikiLeaks. Stone has pleaded not guilty and says he did nothing wrong. He and supporters also have leveled intense criticism at the government before and since his arrest, including of the FBI, the Justice Department and then Jackson herself. Stone's Instagram post on Monday suggested that conspirators within the \"deep state\" had schemed to put his case before an ostensibly unfair Jackson so she could preside over a \"show trial.\" A shape like the crosshairs of a rifle scope appeared in the backdrop of the photo. The post was then deleted. Stone submitted a written apology, but Jackson ordered that he appear on Thursday to explain himself. In a surprise move, Stone took the stand himself to testify under oath at Thursday's hearing. He apologized again, and called the post a \"stupid lapse in judgement.\" He said he was under an immense amount of pressure as well as emotional and financial stress. Jackson, however, was unmoved. She noted that after Stone's initial apology was filed with the court this week, he appeared on TV defending the photograph and calling the uproar an unfair media attack on him.

The federal judge in Roger Stone's case has ordered him to appear in court this week following a critical post about her that was shared on his Instagram account. Judge Amy Berman Jackson scheduled a hearing for Thursday at which Stone will be required to argue why Jackson should not alter the gag order she has imposed or reconsider the bail Stone was granted after his arrest. A post appeared on Stone's Instagram account on Monday with a caption that criticized the \"show trial\" over which Jackson would preside, the latest element in a publicity campaign Stone has been carrying on since he was charged. The caption that accompanied the photo of Jackson alluded to legal machinations by the \"Deep State\" that had set Stone up for a \"show trial\" in Jackson's court. The Instagram post was deleted, and Stone submitted documents apologizing to Jackson. The judge had held open the prospect of modifying her gag order on Friday in the order that made clear she was trying to preserve her ability to seat an impartial jury and \"maintain the dignity and seriousness of the courthouse and these proceedings.\" Stone, meanwhile, has been trying to raise money for a legal defense fund and told supporters in an earlier email that he has been reduced to surviving on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

A number of Republicans have raised concerns about the way Stone was arrested at his home on Jan. 25. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Cindy Falco di Corrado joins with others to show their support for Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to President Trump. A number of Republicans have raised concerns about the way Stone was arrested at his home on Jan. 25. In the predawn hours of Jan. 25, more than a dozen FBI agents raided Roger Stone's home in South Florida and took into custody one of President Trump's closest longtime confidants. CNN showed the agents moving up the driveway with weapons and flashlights in footage that critics have said is shocking. But was it unusual? The short answer: No. Law enforcement agencies often conduct early-morning arrests or raids with large numbers of officers and tactical equipment. The long answer: Republicans, including President Trump, say the FBI took unusual steps in the Stone arrest and they want answers. \u201cFBI. Open the door.\u201dWatch exclusive CNN footage of the FBI arresting longtime Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone has been indicted by a grand jury on charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. https://t.co/IWQToxEDhG pic.twitter.com/qXDtpL8pjN \"I thought it was very unusual,\" said Trump, in an interview with The Daily Caller. The president added: \"Many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. And I thought it was sad to see it. Very sad.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray with a number of questions about the arrest, including whether it was similar in procedure to others with similar charges and why Stone wasn't allowed to just surrender voluntarily. \"Although I am sure these tactics would be standard procedure for the arrest of a violent offender, I have questions regarding their necessity in this case,\" Graham wrote. Republican House members Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., also wrote to Wray, as well as to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and forwarded their letter to the Justice Department's inspector general. Jordan and Meadows have spent much of the past two years criticizing aspects of the investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, and they said the manner in which Stone's arrest was carried was \"unsettling.\" Stone himself has also been outspoken since the arrest, saying the FBI used \"greater force\" than was used in operations conducted on drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n and Osama bin Laden. The FBI and Justice Department so far haven't responded publicly to the questions raised by the president and GOP members of Congress. CNN, meanwhile, did respond to questions about how it knew to position cameras outside Stone's house on the morning he was arrested. The network didn't get a tip, it says. Its correspondents noticed that the grand jury that indicted Stone had met on an unusual day \u2014 Thursday, rather than Friday, as it normally does. That led the network to guess there could be an indictment unsealed shortly thereafter against someone involved in the Russia investigation, and one of the people it had been watching was Stone. \"Commonplace\" Michael German, a former FBI special agent and now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, said Stone's comparisons to the other raids were \"ridiculous\" and that armed arrests of this nature seem to have become standard over the past 20 years. \"It's become much more commonplace to use either SWAT teams or tactically trained agents to do arrests across the board,\" German said. Authorities must take many factors into consideration before they take someone into custody, he said. \"They have the responsibility to not only protect their agents, but the public at large and even the person they are arresting. Often the way to do that is with overwhelming force that would tend to dissuade any resistance.\" A number of other legal experts and former law enforcement officials also have responded over the past week, to say Stone's arrest was not out of the ordinary \u2014 especially in a case in which prosecutors say they feared Stone might have tried to flee or destroy evidence. \"Was the FBI's show of force too heavy-handed, as has been alleged? Absolutely not,\" wrote James Gagliano, a former FBI agent, in a column for the Washington Examiner. \"In the FBI, we tend to defuse situations by removing the fight-or-flight inclination, via our overwhelming presence. To arrest one, we bring 10. For 10, we'll bring 100,\" he also explained. Apart from the question about whether the procedures in Stone's arrest were uncommon, German said the question it has raised is a sound one: Has law enforcement in the United States become overmilitarized? \"While it might be perfectly justifiable in this case based on what little we know, I would want to see Congress looking at this as a systemic issue,\" German told NPR. He also said Stone may have himself contributed to the way the FBI planned his arrest by his bombastic remarks, which have included posing with weapons and \"training\" at a firing range in case of a \"civil war.\" \"Part of the problem is, if you act crazy in public, you take the risk of people believing it,\" German said. \"If you're saying things about resisting the government, then the government has to imagine that you might do that.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images hide caption After years of light regulation, the tech industry is coming under scrutiny from Congress and regulators due to a series of privacy breaches. For years, the big tech companies have been given pretty much a free rein by Capitol Hill to act as they chose. What congressional oversight of the industry, there was largely focused on whether there was political bias on various platforms. But in an abrupt reversal this week, Congress is holding oversight hearings, and lawmakers are proposing new regulations in a crackdown on how big tech companies use and resell their customers' personal information. The change is driven in part by the new Democratic majority in the House, along with younger and more tech-savvy lawmakers in both parties. \"They want to know\" The constant stream of reports about how data is being used by companies like Facebook and Google (both of which have been NPR funders) shows that self-regulation hasn't worked, said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. \"In the last two weeks alone, we learned that Facebook exposed individuals' private health information that consumers thought was in a protected closed group,\" Schakowsky told NPR, \"and collected data from third-party apps ... on issues as personal as women's menstrual cycles and cancer treatment.\" Schakowsky says legislation \"that sets the terms on privacy\" is needed. \"And I think what consumers really want is transparency. They want to know what's actually being collected. They want some control and then they want some accountability.\" There aren't many issues in Congress with bipartisan support these days, but the need for stricter privacy rules for tech companies is one. Republicans agree that it's time to set some limits on what big tech companies can do with personal data. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, says he has \"not met a single American who has ever fully read the fine print of some sort of agreement when you download an app or get an update.\" \"You know you're going to update it and you're going to push agree, and you're not reading the privacy policy of that company,\" he said, \"and the question is did they even follow their own privacy policies or are the privacy policies adequate?\" It's complicated Across the Capitol, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, freshman Sen. Josh Hawley grilled Google's senior privacy counsel on the company's location-tracking policy for its Android mobile operating system, noting that users of Android phones can't turn off the location-tracking function. \"Do you think an average consumer who uses your products fully understands Google builds a profile about her, tracks where she goes to work, tracks where her boyfriend lives, tracks where she goes to church, tracks when she goes to the doctor?\" the Missouri Republican asked Will DeVries. \"Do you think that an average consumer would anticipate that?\" DeVries responded that Google has a duty \"to communicate this information clearly,\" adding, \"I don't believe we track that information at that level without communicating it.\" \"It's a complicated subject,\" he said, because some of that data is needed to make the user's phone operate properly. But Hawley said, \"What's complicated is you don't allow consumers to stop your tracking of them. You tell them that you do ... but in fact you're still gathering the information.\" Hawley \u2014 along with Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. \u2014 introduced legislation to protect the online privacy of minors. The measure, according to a press release from the senators, would prohibit \"internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent and from anyone 13- to 15-years old without the user's consent.\" It's one of a number of bills expected to be introduced by lawmakers from both parties and chambers in the coming months. Getting states on the same page GOP lawmakers and the tech industry want to ensure that whatever steps Congress takes to enact privacy regulations supersede any measures enacted by the states. California has already approved its own strict privacy legislation. Dave Grimaldi of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which represents Facebook, Amazon (also an NPR funder) and Google among others, said the tech industry is willing to go along with new privacy regulations. But he told NPR that the industry can't navigate 50 different laws, nor could consumers. \"The Internet is global,\" Grimaldi said. \"It most certainly goes over state lines. And I think that that changing or altering the Internet experience state to state would be something that would be a giant turnoff to consumers and just wouldn't help anyone.\" More scrutiny to come The tech companies are facing a challenge on another front. The Federal Trade Commission last week announced a task force to take a look at recent industry mergers. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it's a long overdue step. \"I think they probably should have set up that task force more than a decade ago,\" Rotenberg said, \"around the time they were approving the mergers that allowed for example Google to acquire DoubleClick, the big Internet advertising firm, or Facebook to acquire WhatsApp, which was a competing messaging service. Those deals should have been subject to much more scrutiny than they were at the time.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: FaceApp is a program that takes your photos and transforms you into a much older version of yourself. By now, you're either probably using it yourself or you've seen a friend or a celebrity show off their transformation on social media. FaceApp was developed in Russia by Russians, and that has raised a big question. How might those photos be used? The Democratic National Committee doesn't want to take chances, and it's telling presidential campaign staffers to, quote, \"delete the app immediately.\" Geoffrey Fowler is a technology columnist at The Washington Post. He ran his own forensic analysis of FaceApp, and he talked to the company's CEO. Geoffrey, good morning. GEOFFREY FOWLER: Good morning. KING: So explain how FaceApp works because the end results are pretty cool. It's neat to see yourself much older. FOWLER: It's a wonder of artificial intelligence that it can map all these points on anybody's face and then figure out how to morph them just enough to kind of figure out what your future self might look like. It's actually been around since 2017 with other capabilities - it can also change your gender or your hair - but people really started paying attention to it recently with this aging effect. KING: You did an analysis of FaceApp. Should users - and this is the big question. Should users be worried about privacy and security? Where are those photos going? FOWLER: All really good questions. I think you should worry about FaceApp, but not necessarily any more than all the other apps on your phone. I think it's great that this app has caused us to have a conversation about, hey, wait a minute; where's my data going? Is it possibly going into the hands of the Russian government? And we have some answers to those questions, but not all the ones that we necessarily want. But I didn't see anything under the hood that made this app seem any more particularly dangerous than a lot of the other ones that are also really popular. KING: The fact that it was developed in Russia by Russians doesn't alone make it a security risk, but Democratic leaders are worried about it. Can you explain why? FOWLER: One of the things that makes FaceApp controversial is that it has this privacy policy and terms of service that privacy advocates have started poring through, and it's really broad. It basically says that this app has the right to take your photo and hold onto it and use it kind of however they want for as long as they want. So that kind of language is actually pretty common in a lot of companies' terms of service. You'll even see that, like, in Instagram and Facebook. But we now look at Russian companies a little bit differently, especially after the 2016 election where we know Russian technology had a role in shaping that election. KING: Yeah. FOWLER: I think we also look differently now at apps that are collecting pictures of our faces because we've been having a big conversation about the power of facial recognition and how that might be used. KING: You talked to FaceApp's CEO. What did he tell you? FOWLER: He offered some specifics about what his app is doing to respect our privacy that the terms of service and privacy policy and his website don't really offer, and I think some of them are important. So he said, for example, FaceApp only uploads one photo at a time, not your phone's entire camera roll. There were some people that presumed that it had access to every single photo and was sending that all up into the cloud, and that is not the case. I also saw that in my forensic analysis. Another important thing he said is that FaceApp deletes most of the photos from its systems after 48 hours. So again, we have to believe the CEO on this, but he says most of them are gone after two days. The other thing he said that I think is important is that they're not using these photos to do something else. They're not running some kind of side business in facial recognition. They're really only using this to provide the service in the app, which is to morph your face into something cool. KING: And if people do want to delete their data, is there someplace they can go and figure out how to do that quickly? FOWLER: Yeah. Well, it doesn't really help just to delete the app itself because, as we've learned, your photos are going into the cloud and being processed in a server elsewhere. But you can go in the app. And if you go into the bug report settings and you submit a bug report and you start it with the word privacy, the company says they will pay attention to that one and delete the data of yours that they've got on their server.

NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Matthew Kluger, a law professor at NorthwesternUniversity, about how biometric privacy laws are affecting tech companies in certain states. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: I spent a few minutes today doing something millions of Americans have done in recent days - trying out the Google Arts and Culture app. Here we go. Take a selfie and search thousands of artworks to see if any look like you. Get started. All right, three, two, one - cheese. Yeah, so the app is just what it sounds like. You take a selfie. You get an instant match with a great work of art that is supposed to resemble you. Sometimes the result is less than flattering. (Laughter) It actually doesn't look anything like me, so I'm going to try this one more time. Oh, I'm liking this one. This is a portrait of Thirza Whysall from the collection of the Royal College of Music painted by Elizabeth Robinson McCallum. She does have kind of wavy blonde hair. She's playing a violin. So there you go, my inner artiste is coming out. (Laughter) OK, so that's how the app is supposed to work. Here's the thing - if I were sitting in Texas or in Illinois, I couldn't do this. The app doesn't work. Law professor Matthew Kugler of Northwestern University has studied Illinois' biometric privacy laws, and he joins us now. Welcome. MATTHEW KUGLER: Thank you. Thank you. KELLY: You are in Chicago right now. Explain for us what happens if you try to open the app and use the art selfie feature. KUGLER: So what people have been discovering - and this was not publicized, they've been discovering it as they attempt to do it - is that the option is simply not available. And what has become apparent over the last two days in particular is that Google has intentionally disabled this functionality in Illinois and in Texas in response to the biometric privacy laws. KELLY: Google has not actually put out a statement one way or the other. We're reaching out to them to see what their take on this is. But what you're describing there is biometric law in Illinois that restricts the amount of information that tech companies can collect from users like you or me. KUGLER: Yes. So in these two states, if you want to collect those biometrics you have to give certain disclosures to people telling them what you're going to do with the information. You have to get their permission for a variety of things. And even with that there are restrictions on how you can share the information and whether you can sell it. KELLY: Now, in this case, we looked. Google does have a disclaimer on the app. It says - and I'll quote it - \"Google won't use data from your photo for any other purpose and will only store your photo for the time it takes to search for matches.\" And it makes you choose either I accept or, you know, don't accept and then you don't proceed. So with that disclaimer, how does the app not satisfy Illinois legal requirements? KUGLER: My impression is that Google is showing an abundance of caution here. The law is still being litigated in a number of courts. Google is involved in litigation involving the law. And they may be concerned that someone might upload someone else's picture and therefore they don't have the consent of the person whose image is being captured. That's a problem with home security cameras. And there's a Nest product not available in Illinois as far as we can tell because of this concern. KELLY: Nest, we should mention, is another technology company, uses biometric data for different applications. And it's owned by the same parent company as Google. KUGLER: Yes. So I'm wondering if there's perhaps some Google-wide understanding of caution, though obviously Google has not been forthcoming explaining exactly why it's doing some of these things. KELLY: Why was this law passed in Illinois in the first place? This was to protect privacy rights of residents there. KUGLER: Yes. There was a company going through bankruptcy in Illinois that had a fair bit of biometric data. And as it was going through bankruptcy, there was concern that the data had been collected when consumers had certain impressions of how it was going to be used. And in bankruptcy, that data might be sold to someone else who has completely different intentions. So maybe you trust Google with certain data, but for Google to hand that data off to someone else you wouldn't trust them. So this law was passed in part to avoid that kind of unintended consequence. KELLY: And meanwhile, to loop us back to where we began, are people in Illinois finding ways to circumvent this law? KUGLER: Several of my friends have commented that when they travel out of state they're going to make a point to stop by the side of the road and make use of this feature (laughter). How much they care is unclear. This is perhaps the flavor of the moment, and in a week we'll all wonder why we cared. KELLY: We'll all be moving on to being agitated about something else. Matthew Kugler, thanks very much. KUGLER: Thank you. KELLY: That's Matthew Kugler of the Pritzker School of Law at Northwestern University. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Al Drago/Reuters hide caption Christopher Wylie, former Cambridge Analytica employee, prepares to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Updated at 12:52 p.m. ET Cambridge Analytica used Facebook to find and target Americans to trigger paranoia and racial biases, a former employee of the data analytics company told lawmakers on Wednesday. \"Cambridge Analytica sought to identify mental and emotional characteristics in certain subsets of the American population and worked to exploit them by designing them to activate some of the worst vulnerabilities in people, such as neuroticism, paranoia and racial biases,\" Christopher Wylie told the Senate Judiciary Committee. Wylie worked for Cambridge Analytica in 2013 and 2014, and he's largely credited as the person who blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica's indiscretions. He's testifying on Capitol Hill as a part of an ongoing congressional probe into Facebook's misuse of users' personal information. Cambridge Analytica was working with the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The firm has denied using the information to target voters. Wylie told lawmakers that during his time at Cambridge Analytica, employees of its parent corporation SCL Group were in contact with Lukoil, Russia's second-largest oil company. Lukoil is subject to U.S. sanctions and has been linked to Russian influence operations in the past. Wylie also told lawmakers the SCL Group worked to assess attitudes towards Vladimir Putin in Eastern Europe and complement Russian information operations in former Soviet bloc countries. Cambridge Analytica gained access to vast amounts of user data from its relationship with Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at the University of Cambridge. Kogan created a personality test that Facebook users could take. As part of signing up, they also gave access to most of their personal data, including location data, every Facebook page they liked and access to all of their friends' profiles. Most users were likely not aware that the fine print in Kogan's survey told them their data could be used for commercial purposes \u2014 a clear violation of Facebook policies. Wylie talked about his conversations with Kogan while the two worked at Cambridge Analytica. \"What I can say is that the lead researcher, Dr. Kogan, was at the time, working on projects that were related to psychological profiling in Russia,\" Wylie said. \"I can't say for sure that this (Facebook user) data ended up in Russia.\" In response to more questions about Kogan's affiliation with Russia's St. Petersburg University, Wylie said it would have been \"very easy\" for the Russian government to obtain the Facebook data he had gathered. Wylie also said that Cambridge Analytica had hired at least two senior staffers who had been aides to the British lawyer John Jones, who represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange is currently living at the London-based embassy for Ecuador. He's a particularly controversial figure in the United States, because of his role in releasing classified documents through WikiLeaks. The hearing comes despite Facebook's public efforts to clean up its efforts on protecting privacy. Earlier this week, Facebook announced it had suspended about 200 app developers for suspicious use of personal data. According to a Monday blog post by Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice president of product partnerships, the company has investigated thousands of apps that had access to large amounts of information in 2014, before the company changed its policies reducing the data that apps could access. Republican lawmakers on the committee repeatedly stressed that data analysis has been used in politics since the 1990's. Sen. Ted Cruz asked witnesses to detail how the Obama campaign used Facebook data in the 2008 and 2012, suggesting that Facebook gave preferential access to those seeking to elect Democrats. Christopher Wylie pushed back. \"A lot of people are concerned about, for example, the ability of big government to inhibit our liberties and choice. Big data can engineer a situation that limits our choice and our freedom. And it's not a partisan issue,\" Wylie said. The misuse of the personal data by Cambridge Analytica has heated up scrutiny of Facebook's privacy policies. CEO Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress last month to testify.

        "texts": "Bill Chappell In many cases, federal agents can request access to state DMV records by filling out a form. This is an example of a Homeland Security request that was made to the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles in 2017. Georgetown Law hide caption In many cases, federal agents can request access to state DMV records by filling out a form. This is an example of a Homeland Security request that was made to the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles in 2017. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents mine millions of driver's license photos for possible facial recognition matches \u2014 and some of those efforts target undocumented immigrants who have legally obtained driver's licenses, according to researchers at Georgetown University Law Center, which obtained documents related to the searches. Federal agencies have not gotten congressional approval to use state DMV records as a massive database, says Alvaro Bedoya, the founding director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology. He adds that the searches often take place without state residents' awareness or approval. In some cases, Bedoya says, ICE has used facial recognition to sift through data in states that have urged undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. \"In our view, this is a scandal, and huge betrayal of undocumented people,\" Bedoya tells NPR's Morning Edition. His group received the official records through Freedom of Information Act requests made to police departments and DMV offices around the country. More than a dozen U.S. states allow undocumented immigrants to get a formal license or driver privilege card. In at least three of those states \u2014 Washington, Utah and Vermont \u2014 ICE agents are \"actually taking advantage of that to secretly find and deport those people using face recognition technology,\" Bedoya says. In response to an NPR request for comment, ICE officials sent a statement saying the agency \"will not comment on investigative techniques, tactics or tools.\" It adds that ICE has the ability to collaborate with other local, federal and international agencies \"to obtain information that may assist in case completion and prosecution efforts.\" The ICE statement concludes, \"This is an established procedure that is consistent with other law-enforcement agencies.\" News of ICE's use of facial recognition software to sift through state databases was first reported by The Washington Post, drawing on documents collected by Bedoya and his team. His colleagues include Clare Garvie, who says via Twitter that in Utah, federal access was granted despite the Legislature's explicit stance against such practices. \"The Utah legislature rejected the federal info-sharing required under the REAL ID Act as 'inimical to the security and well-being' of the state and 'adopted in violation of the principles of federalism,' \" Garvie wrote on Monday. Similarly, on the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles page about its driver privilege card, the agency highlights the fact that it \"is NOT Real ID compliant.\" Facial recognition can be particularly dangerous, critics such as Garvie and Bedoya say, because recent studies have found the technology both unreliable and biased, putting people at risk of being falsely connected to a crime or investigation. \"I think it's really important for folks to realize that even if you're not undocumented it does affect you,\" Bedoya says, \"because the software is biased and doesn't really protect or find people of color, women or young people really well.\" \"The question isn't whether you're undocumented \u2014 but rather whether a flawed algorithm thinks you look like someone who's undocumented,\" Bedoya says. Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about the accuracy of recognition systems and the lack of privacy restrictions that would prevent federal agents from mining state databases. Responding to the Georgetown Law report, Rep. Brian S. King, D-Utah, said via Twitter, \"It is not OK that the Utah state DMV officials turned over data to ICE to help set up a surveillance system.\" King added, \"I'll be joining with legislative colleagues to get answers about how this happened. I'm sure our concerns will be bipartisan.\" Doubts about the accuracy and ethics of using facial recognition also recently prompted Axon, the largest maker of police body cameras, to reject the idea of selling facial recognition technology. As for the authorization or permission federal agencies need to get before they can use facial recognition to search driver's license photos, the process often involves filling out a request form, according to a review of about a dozen state documents Georgetown Law shared with NPR. While some records referred to an administrative subpoena, none mentioned a search warrant. \"What happens is that ICE takes advantage of a two-decade-old law that says that in general, DMV should cooperate with law enforcement,\" Bedoya says. \"And this law was written before face recognition existed. ICE uses it to ask that the DMVs comply. And the DMVs do so \u2014 usually in secret and without telling the people in the state.\" In a follow-up email, Bedoya said of the administrative subpoena ICE uses to request the search, \"This is not a court order or a warrant, this is just ICE saying that they have the authority to ask for this search, and then asking for the search.\" ICE is not the only federal agency to be scrutinized for applying face recognition software to state driver records. One month ago, the House Oversight Committee quizzed an FBI official about the agency's use of face recognition to mine state databases. That hearing followed a report from the Government Accountability Office that said the FBI's face recognition office can search the databases of 21 states, with more than 641 million photos. After hearing Goodwin's testimony about the GAO's report, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that it was time \"for Congress to act to protect Americans' liberties.\" In that hearing, the GAO's Gretta Goodwin, director of its homeland security and justice unit, mentioned that the GAO had faulted the FBI's handling of face recognition and privacy concerns in May 2016 \u2014 and that out of six recommendations the GAO made, the FBI had fully addressed only one. A key complaint, the GAO said, was that the FBI had still not taken steps \"to determine whether state database searches are accurate enough to support law enforcement investigations.\" Long before facial recognition became an option for investigators, law enforcement agencies routinely shared booking photos and fingerprints from criminal records. But after decades of that practice, the FBI started to institute a \"next generation\" system in 2010 that could include biometric data such as face recognition, the GAO said. The GAO also described an FBI unit called FACE Services, which can draw on databases run by federal and state agencies. While earlier face-recognition collaborations used photos from within the criminal justice system, the GAO said, \"these external systems primarily contain photos from state and federal government databases, such as driver's license photos and visa applicant photos.\" Outlining how FACE Services works in that same House oversight hearing, the FBI's Kimberly Del Greco said the unit uses software to generate \"potential candidates\" that are then manually compared with the original search photo. Del Greco, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services, said that the face recognition analysis that results from the process \"does not provide positive identification, but rather, an investigative lead\" that is assessed by FBI agents. FACE Services \"has performed 390,186 searches on a variety of databases only in support of active FBI investigations with no findings of civil liberties violations or evidence of system misuse,\" Del Greco said, citing an internal audit that was completed last December. Only in limited instances, Del Greco said, does the unit assist other federal agencies with face recognition. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Richard Drew/AP hide caption Facebook said Wednesday that the number of users whose personal information was revealed to Cambridge Analytica was 87 million, not 50 million. Updated at 6:40 p.m. ET Personal information of up to 87 million people \u2014 mostly in the United States \u2014 may have been \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm used by the Trump campaign that has recently come under fire. Facebook's Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer gave the figure Wednesday at the end of a lengthy blog post outlining ways the social media giant is working to better protect user data. Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica's former director of research turned whistleblower, had previously said the firm accessed personal information of more than 50 million users. The sharp uptick of users potentially affected comes as Facebook is undergoing intense scrutiny over how it protects \u2014 or fails to protect \u2014 the data of its more than two billion users. Also Wednesday Facebook Mark CEO Zuckerberg confirmed he will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about data privacy issues. Facebook is urgently trying to convey that it is working to protect user information, even if it has been negligent in that regard before. \"It's clear now that we didn't do enough,\" Zuckerberg said to reporters in a call on Wednesday. \"We didn't focus enough on preventing abuse and thinking through about how people could use these tools to do harm.\" Zuckerberg says that harm includes \"fake news, foreign interference in elections, hate speech, in addition to developers and data privacy.\" He went on, \"We didn't take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is and that was a huge mistake.\" Zuckerberg specified it was his mistake, but denied he had any plans to step down as Facebook's CEO. As to why Facebook is only now saying 87 million people may have been affected after the 50 million figure has been widely reported for weeks, \"We only just finalized our understanding of this situation in the last couple of days,\" Zuckerberg said. Last month, Wylie spoke to multiple media outlets and portrayed Cambridge Analytica, his former employer, as excavating a massive trove of Facebook user data to try to steer voters on behalf of its political clients. \"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" Wylie told The New York Times of the company's leaders. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\" Facebook conceded last month that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information from some 270,000 users who downloaded an app developed by Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University psychology professor, as well as the information of the users' unwitting friends. The social media company did not say at the time how many people were affected, but noted it was against platform policy for third parties to access user information. Facebook said it learned of the violation in 2015 and was told by all parties the data was deleted but that it later learned that those assurances may have been false. Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday that it is no longer enough for Facebook to require and believe that developers are protecting information, \"we actually have to ensure that everyone in our ecosystem protects people's information.\" Among the changes Facebook says it is making to be more transparent about what apps people are interacting with, include making it easier for users to see what information they have shared with those apps and making it easier for users to delete the apps if they wish. Another step Facebook is taking: removing a feature that allowed users to search for a profile by entering a person's phone number or email address because \"malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information,\" Schroepfer said in his post. \"Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we've seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way,\" he said. Schroepfer says more changes are coming \"over the coming months\" to better protect users' Facebook information. \"This is a big shift for us to take a lot more responsibility for how each of the tools are used,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's going to take some time and we're committed to getting that right.\" For its part, Cambridge Analytica says it deleted all of the information it received from the company led by Kogan when it learned that its retrieval violated Facebook's terms of service. Cambridge Analytica denies that any of the data \"was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Aarti Shahani Biometric data is considered a special category requiring explicit consent under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation law, which goes into effect Friday. JaysonPhotography/Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH via AP hide caption Biometric data is considered a special category requiring explicit consent under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation law, which goes into effect Friday. The U.S. takes credit for creating the Internet, and the European Union seems determined to govern it. On Friday, a sweeping new directive goes into effect called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Taken together, its 99 articles represent the biggest ever change to data privacy laws. The new rules have implications for U.S. Internet users too. Here are answers to three questions you might have about the new law and its potential impacts. What is GDPR? It's a new law that protects residents of the EU \u2014 people living there, including Americans. (If you're a European and live in the U.S., you're not protected.) Under GDPR, all companies that have an Internet presence \u2014 including large American companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 have to comply. At the most basic level, GDPR expands what counts as personal data and your rights over that data. Your data is, for example, what you post on social media, your electronic medical records and your mailing address. It's also your IP address (a string of numbers that's unique to your smartphone or laptop), as well as GPS location. The directive says people have to give permission for a company to collect their data. A company can't just sign you up without explicitly asking. And the more personal the data \u2014 say, biometrics, which is considered a special category under the law \u2014 the ask must be even more clear. Europeans have a right to have their data deleted if they don't want a company to keep it. Companies have to delete the data without undue delay, or face a penalty. I live in the U.S. How does it impact me? If you're American, you're probably getting a lot of emails and push notifications from your apps and maybe even newsletters you forgot you signed up for. For example, new privacy notices from Spotify and eBay say you can request to delete personal data they've stored. \"But there's nothing binding about it,\" says attorney Michael R. Cohen, who is based in Minneapolis. \"In the U.S., the business model is pretty much, companies can do what they want, so long as there isn't a specific law prohibiting it.\" The U.S. has laws protecting data privacy for health and financial records, and and for children. \"Other than that, we're pretty much the Wild West,\" Cohen says. That's how as many as 87 million Facebook users had their profiles land in the hands of a political operative. Last month, in testimony before Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he'd give Americans all the same controls Europeans have. \"We believe that everyone around the world deserves good privacy controls. We've had a lot of these controls in place for years. The GDPR requires us to do a few more things, and we're going to extend that to the world,\" he said. In reality, Zuckerberg isn't offering the same protections. For Facebook users, there is a big difference between Europe and the U.S. when it comes to what is collected by default. In Europe, Facebook has to get permission to do facial recognition \u2014 and it's not the default setting. But in the U.S., it is. American users have to click through screens to opt out. Will the new law hurt businesses that rely on data collection? That is a key debate right now. One side argues that GDPR will be terrible for competition, giving big businesses a leg up over small ones. Small companies won't be able to afford the millions of dollars in expenses that come with managing and protecting data. So they won't survive. Another camp argues that consumers don't trust businesses on the Internet anymore anyway (as evidenced by the rise of ad blockers). If that's the real problem, the laws will make a difference by making businesses think more deeply about what data they collect and why, and GDPR may improve the quality of the Internet. But it's too early now and this is all a guessing game at this point. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Nina Totenberg is NPR's award-winning legal affairs correspondent. Her reports air regularly on NPR's critically acclaimed newsmagazines All Things Considered, Morning Edition, and Weekend Edition. Totenberg's coverage of the Supreme Court and legal affairs has won her widespread recognition. She is often featured in documentaries \u2014 most recently RBG \u2014 that deal with issues before the court. As Newsweek put it, \"The mainstays [of NPR] are Morning Edition and All Things Considered. But the creme de la creme is Nina Totenberg.\" In 1991, her ground-breaking report about University of Oklahoma Law Professor Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment by Judge Clarence Thomas led the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings to consider Hill's charges. NPR received the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award for its gavel-to-gavel coverage \u2014 anchored by Totenberg \u2014 of both the original hearings and the inquiry into Anita Hill's allegations, and for Totenberg's reports and exclusive interview with Hill. That same coverage earned Totenberg additional awards, including the Long Island University George Polk Award for excellence in journalism; the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for investigative reporting; the Carr Van Anda Award from the Scripps School of Journalism; and the prestigious Joan S. Barone Award for excellence in Washington-based national affairs/public policy reporting, which also acknowledged her coverage of Justice Thurgood Marshall's retirement. Totenberg was named Broadcaster of the Year and honored with the 1998 Sol Taishoff Award for Excellence in Broadcasting from the National Press Foundation. She is the first radio journalist to receive the award. She is also the recipient of the American Judicature Society's first-ever award honoring a career body of work in the field of journalism and the law. In 1988, Totenberg won the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton for her coverage of Supreme Court nominations. The jurors of the award stated, \"Ms. Totenberg broke the story of Judge (Douglas) Ginsburg's use of marijuana, raising issues of changing social values and credibility with careful perspective under deadline pressure.\" Totenberg has been honored seven times by the American Bar Association for continued excellence in legal reporting and has received more than two dozen honorary degrees. On a lighter note, in 1992 and 1988 Esquire magazine named her one of the \"Women We Love\". A frequent contributor on TV shows, she has also written for major newspapers and periodicals \u2014 among them, The New York Times Magazine, The Harvard Law Review, The Christian Science Monitor, and New York Magazine, and others.

        "title": "Infertile Women In Africa Are The Focus Of A Music Campaign From Merck : Goats and Soda : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "Malaka Gharib In June, an unusual email arrived in the inbox of an NPR global health correspondent. The headline was: \"Merck Foundation together with First Lady of Burundi release 'Plus Qu'une Mere' an empowering French Song as courtesy to all infertile women in Burundi and Africa.\" The email had a link to a video of a performance with an all-female choir. Wearing traditional African clothing printed with the Merck Foundation's logo, they sing a song with lyrics that encourage people not to blame women for infertility. They're performing before an audience of maybe a hundred people, most of them in similar Merck garb. The video raises a number of questions: Can a song be helpful to women who are infertile? What is the role of the First Lady of Burundi in this project? And ... why is nearly everyone in the choir and audience wearing the Merck logo? To learn more, NPR spoke to the Merck Foundation and to specialists who deal with infertility and the impact of musical health messages. The song is part of an ongoing campaign called \"More Than A Mother\" from Merck Foundation, the charitable arm of the pharmaceutical company Merck KGaA Germany. Since 2016, the Foundation has been staging music videos, performances and songs (as well as fashion shows and media trainings) to send the message to African countries that a woman should not be blamed if she is unable to bear children. The campaign messaging also notes that for those women and men who do seek fertility treatments, Merck has options. (As for the garb of the choir singers, one global health researcher interviewed by NPR was not concerned. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, explains Jocelyn E. Finlay, a senior research scientist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, it's common for community leaders to celebrate special events by printing large swaths of traditional African fabric with the logo of a sponsoring group for guests to turn into clothing.) Merck's efforts are important because infertility is an under-researched issue around the world, says Finlay, who studies reproductive health in low-income countries. \"The overall message is not a bad one,\" she says of Merck's campaign. \"Not much [in terms of funds and research] is going on for maternal health right now \u2014 priorities are shifting elsewhere. Merck is one of the few organizations that prioritize women's health in developing countries\" through research, partnerships with local health care institutions and public education. And Merck is doing more than hosting fashion shows and making music videos. The Foundation also sponsors an Embryology & Fertility Training Program, a three-month course in clinical and practical matters in more than 30 countries across Africa and Asia. Since 2015, the program has trained 109 fertility specialists. Rasha Kelej, CEO of Merck Foundation, said she could not share the budget of the program because the figure is \"hard to extract.\" It is part of Merck's larger effort to provide training to health-care workers in the developing world on such medical concerns as cancer, diabetes and rehabilitation, she says. And that broader effort includes support and financial contributions from its partners, including the Manipal Academy of Higher Education in India and the International Institute for Training and Research in Reproductive Health in the form of free tuition and other donations. The infertility program is especially critical in sub-Saharan Africa. While the region has some of the highest birth rates in the world, it also has one of the highest rates of infertility globally, according to the World Health Organization. Around the world, more than 180 million couples face infertility. In the poorest countries, the 12-month infertility prevalence rate \u2014 failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sex \u2014 ranges from 6.9 to 9.3%, according to WHO. As in many parts of the world, women in sub-Saharan Africa who can't have children often feel a sense of shame. \"There is an expectation that women can bear children. And when they don't get pregnant, then it's assumed it's the woman's fault,\" says Finlay. Most cases of infertility in this region are caused by infections, for example STDs or pelvic infections, according to a 2011 study in Facts, Views and Vision in OB-GYN. Some of these causes are treatable, but the techniques are often too expensive for the majority of the population. And there are few fertility specialists and treatments on the continent, says Finlay. Merck Foundation, says Kelej, is ramping up fertility services to people from all income levels. In addition to its training program, it has teamed up with the International Federation of Fertility Societies to provide fertility services to public hospitals across Africa. The idea is to provide low-income patients who are trying to conceive with basic treatments \u2014 for example, removing fibroids or treating infections. In this partnership, Merck connects African fertility specialists to technical experts who travel to the local clinic. They demonstrate how to use the medical equipment or provide assistance in setting up an in-vitro fertilization center. So far, Merck and IFFS have helped set up fertility clinics in public hospitals in Uganda and Guinea. \"We want women and couples to have access to everything: information and health. We want to change their mindset around infertility and let them know they have a choice,\" says Kelej. The \"More Than A Mother\" campaign has so far launched 14 local songs with singers from Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. Merck says the songs were created to \"empower\" women with the message that there is more to life than being a mother. Men shouldn't blame women if they aren't able to have children. One lyric goes, \"Life is bigger than having children, my friend.\" And the songs point out that infertility can also be an issue for men. In a song called \"Life Is Bigger,\" Rwandan artist Tom Close, sings: \"Yes, she might be the one with the problem. But you might as well be the one with the problem.\" Close is one of the many artists that the Foundation enlisted to create songs and music videos to reflect local culture and language. The musicians also include the local all-female choir from Burundi, a singer named Sunita from Gambia and a Kenyan rapper (with more than a million Instagram followers) known as Octopizzo. And of course, there is the song written and performed by the First Lady of Burundi, H.E. Madam Denise Nkurunziza. Kelej says that Nkurunziza is a singer in her own right and put out versions of her \"More Than A Mother\" song in French, English and Kirundi, a Bantu language spoken in her country. Some of the videos can be found on the Foundation's YouTube channel. The goal is for the songs to get local TV and radio airplay. If done well, musical messaging can be a good strategy, says Carlos Chirinos Espin, a professor of music and global health and the director of New York University's Music and Social Change Lab. \"There is a body of literature that shows entertainment education has a strong ability to change behaviors in health.\" According to the 2019 SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture, music has helped change attitudes and inform the public about diseases from HIV/AIDS to malaria. Espin himself helped develop a campaign during the Ebola crisis called Africa Stop Ebola, to raise awareness about the pandemic. But some global health advocates and ethnomusicologists interviewed for this story say that the \"More Than A Mother\" music videos fall flat. In one video from August 2018, for example, Merck Foundation teamed up with Octopizzo and Rozzi, a singer from Sierra Leone. Titled \"Octopizzo ft. Rozzi, Remix of Merck More Than A Mother Song,\" it shows an African man kicking his wife out of a house because she can't have children. A few scenes later, the woman \u2014 wearing an African print garment and visibly disheveled \u2014 goes to meet with a woman sitting behind a big desk and computer at an office building. That woman is Kelej, CEO of the Merck Foundation. Kelej, an Egyptian national with blonde hair and Western clothing, lifts the woman's downcast face with her hands. Seconds later, the African woman is walking down the hall of a building wearing Western clothing. In the next scenes, her fortune changes. She starts her own business, meets the man of her dreams, gets remarried and \u2014 with the support of her husband, begins infertility treatments. The video is \"problematic,\" says Austin C. Okigbo, an associate professor of global health and ethnomusicology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It makes it seem as if the biomedical intervention solves all problems, but it \"does not solve the culturally rooted problem of blaming women for infertility.\" \"A medical solution [only works] when the cultural biases have been addressed,\" he adds. \"It can be an option for those who wish to go that route. It means that Merck is out to sell their product and not there to address the problem of infertility stigma.\" Kelej disagrees with the criticism. \"I don't believe there is a dual message,\" she says. \"We want women and couples to have access to everything: information and health. We want to change their mindset around infertility and let them know they have a choice.\" The Octopizzo and Rozzi video raises other concerns. Some social justice advocates are uneasy with the imagery in the video featuring Kelej. The African woman's life is only transformed after meeting Kelej and working with the Merck Foundation. The power dynamic between Kelej \u2014 who works for a Western multinational pharmaceutical company \u2014 and the African woman evokes the white savior complex, says Nora Rahimian, the co-founder of #CultureFix, a global network of artists who use the arts to create social change. It feels \"neocolonial. There are power dynamics at play.\" Whether or not the music was effective in helping to change public opinion on infertility is a matter of time and research, says Okigbo. \"The only way you can know is to deploy a qualitative analysis before and after the campaign to see if the level of awareness has changed, maybe after one or two years.\" One thing is certain, say the five researchers interviewed for this story: The Merck Foundation represents a business \u2014 and it has the company's bottom line in mind. \"They are not going to be able to create a demand for their product unless they educate their consumers that they should demand a product,\" says Usha Sundaram, a senior lecturer in consumer and digital marketing at the Norwich Business School at the University of East Anglia. \"It's textbook marketing.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Last month, Bon Iver released a pair of new songs \u2014 \"Hey Ma\" and \"U (Man Like)\" \u2014 with little context to surround them. Last week, it posted a characteristically cryptic minute-long trailer for... well, something, in the process suggesting the completion of some kind of seasonal cycle. Today, we have our answer: Justin Vernon and his band will release their fourth album (titled i,i) on August 30. Bon Iver's intensely beloved debut, For Emma, Forever Ago, was (by definition) a winter album; Vernon famously recorded it while secluded in a Wisconsin cabin and released it nationally in February 2008. Bon Iver came out in the spring of 2011 and symbolized rebirth, while the digitally fried 22, A Million followed in the sun-blasted summer of 2016. It's no accident that i,i will land around the beginning of fall. \"It feels very much like the most adult record, the most complete,\" Vernon writes in announcing i,i. \"It feels like when you get through all this life, when the sun starts to set, and what happens is you start gaining perspective. And then you can put that perspective into more honest, generous work.\" The album will feature a sprawling cast of Bon Iver's players, frequent collaborators and friends, including Moses Sumney, Bruce Hornsby, James Blake, Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, The National's Bryce and Aaron Dessner, Channy Leaneagh from Poli\u00e7a and more. Recorded in a pair of comfort zones \u2014 the band's April Base studio in Wisconsin, followed by a weeks-long run in West Texas \u2014 i,i is meant to evoke a sense of contentment, though some of its meanings will naturally remain a bit opaque. \"The title of the record can mean whatever it means to you or me,\" Vernon writes. \"It can mean deciphering and bolstering one's identity. It can be how important the self is and how unimportant the self is, how we're all connected.\" Naturally, the song titles are a bit of a Bon Iver-ian jumble. i,i comes out August 30 via Jagjaguwar.

Alberto Rodriguez/Disney Enterprises, Inc. hide caption Hans Zimmer, Matt Jones of the Re-Collective Orchestra and conductor Nick Glennie-Smith at a scoring session for Disney's The Lion King. Ready for more Disney d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? The Lion King is the latest software update to one of Disney's beloved animated movies, this time featuring photo-realistic graphics \u2014 and Beyonc\u00e9. The musical performances are all new, but it's the same classic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and composer Hans Zimmer also returned to Pride Rock with an upgraded version of his Oscar-winning score from 25 years ago. When the new movie starts, you'll hear the same iconic proclamation that opened the original Lion King in 1994 \u2014 sung by South African musician Lebo M. \"I didn't even know anything about the movie,\" Lebo M. says. \"I just knew it had something to do with a conflict between a father and a brother, that has a son in it. No detail.\" Lebo M. fled apartheid-era South Africa in 1979 when he was 16. He eventually moved to L.A. in hopes of being a superstar \u2014 but ended up living on Skid Row. A few years later, he was working as a coffee gopher at the studio of Hilton Rosenthal, producer for the late Johnny Clegg. Zimmer stopped by one day and was impressed by Lebo M.'s untapped musical talents, and hired him to write and arrange vocals for the 1992 film, The Power of One. Not long after, Zimmer called him again to help bring some authentic Africana to this animated movie about lions. \"I noticed the image of Mufasa,\" Lebo M. says. \"And my entire system went to: What happens when an important person in my country, my culture, walks in? What happens when a king walks in? The musicology of my thought became [sings] 'Nants' Ingonyama!' \u2014 that then translates to 'All hail the king. All bow down in the presence of the king.'\" Lebo ended up contributing several vocals and vocal arrangements to both the songs and score for The Lion King, which came to feel very personal. \"I am the Simba at this point, who grows up in exile,\" he says. \"I don't go back home to take over a country, but I go back home a professional. And Mufasa, to me, becomes immediately the image of Nelson Mandela.\" That's some heavy subtext for a Disney cartoon \u2014 but there's a seriousness that anchors the whole score. Zimmer, who at the time was best known for grown-up movies like Rain Man and Backdraft, originally took the job for two reasons. First, he says: \"I didn't like Disney musicals. And they were going, 'Great, that's exactly what we want! We don't want somebody who wants to do what we did before.'\" The other reason was for his little girl, Annabel. \"It wasn't for my daughter!\" he clarifies. \"It was for her dad. 'Cause every dad wants to show off. And I couldn't take her to see True Romance or something \u2014 like a shootout or whatever. I thought, 'Oh, no, this'll be good \u2014 it'll be a cartoon, it'll be funny, it'll be harmless. It's about fuzzy animals.' And I didn't realize it was profoundly going to go and hit me in a really hard way... because my dad died when I was 6 years old \u2014 which was her age.\" (In The Lion King, Mufasa \u2014 the king of Pride Rock \u2014 tragically dies while saving his son, Simba, from a wildebeest stampede. The rest of the movie follows how Simba deals with that.) \"There I was,\" Zimmer says, \"And the only thing I could [do] was to open those deep and dark boxes, and let all the darkness out. And so, weirdly, the score is pretty epic and pretty big for a movie about small, fuzzy animals.\" Zimmer says his \"gift\" to the original filmmaking team was insisting to them that \"the emotions are the emotions.\" \"Don't ever talk down to the children,\" he remembers saying. \"They'll catch you at it. Be sincere, be absolutely genuine, be absolutely legitimate about this. Let's not make things easier. Let's not be funny for, like, the wrong reasons. At the same time, you know, the genius of the film is that you go from death of the father to fart jokes.\" Zimmer won his first \u2014 and to date, only \u2014 Oscar for the score. When Disney and director Jon Favreau asked him to score their hyper-realistic 2019 remake, Zimmer knew he wanted a fresh way to revamp the music. That's when he saw a video online of the Re-Collective Orchestra, an all-black ensemble founded by Stephanie Matthews and Matt Jones. They formed last year to record Jones' arrangement of the track \"All the Stars\" from Black Panther. \"We were really inspired by Black Panther,\" Matthews says, \"and so when the film came out, we decided to kind of do a concept piece: 'What would the orchestra of Wakanda look like?'\" Matthews, a session violinist and strings contractor, first met Zimmer in 2014 when she accompanied Pharrell Williams on Saturday Night Live \u2014 but she was shocked when he emailed her saying he'd seen the video and wanted Re-Collective to play on the new Lion King. \"He was really, really passionate about the diversity and representation of having these musicians collaborate with the LA session musicians who are extraordinary players,\" Matthews says, \"And just elevate the level of this project.\" Zimmer's new Lion King score was recorded at Sony Studios in April. Many present, with decades between them, said it was the most diverse film scoring session ever. \"It's really hard to describe the energy in the room, and what happened on that scoring stage,\" Matthews says. \"I mean, the representation and the diversity, but also the energy and the camaraderie, and then just using this shared language of music to translate and to transform this already super iconic score. It was just... it's hard to put into words.\" \"I was going for diversity,\" Zimmer says. \"And then, as soon as everybody started playing and sitting next to each other, it became this amazing thing \u2014 which wasn't diversity at all. It was unity.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

On top of an ongoing, plucky bass line and a series of deeply satisfying guitar riffs, she layers singing that toggles between grounded and breathy to build towards an impassioned, intensely craving vocal close. KP's lyrics in the song are minimal, their words deftly chosen to spin a web of wanting \u2014 wanting, that is, in both its greediest and most intimate forms. \"You know what you want, it's / Only 'bout the money and control / Can't step off it, someone else will cop it / Like it's gold, you're a prophet / Someone's gonna profit,\" KP muses darkly on the second verse. One lyric, in particular, sounds like King Princess singing into a dark reflecting pool. \"No apologies, twisting your words and your prophecies,\" she sings on the bridge. \"And honestly, it's the price of the prodigy-wannabe.\" At only 20 years old, and having already amassed a near-obsessive fanbase, the singer-songwriter is proving to be something of a prodigy herself. Cheap Queen is due out this fall via Mark Ronson's Zelig/Columbia Records. The record also includes the titular track, which the up-and-coming queer icon released as a single and video earlier this summer. If \"Cheap Queen\" and the latest single are any indication, King Princess' first full-length is sure to meet, and likely surpass, the high bar set by her 2018 EP, Make My Bed.

According to a statement, the album was produced and curated by Beyonc\u00e9, who says of the project: \"Each song was written to reflect the film's storytelling that gives the listener a chance to imagine their own imagery, while listening to a new contemporary interpretation.\" The new song opens with a call-and-response, and carries both melodic and lyrical themes from the original 1994 movie; talking winds, gathering stars and opening heavens. \"Spirit, can you hear it calling? / Yeah / Your destiny is coming close, stand up and fight / So go into that far off land / And be one with the great I am, I am,\" she calls. Aside from global star Beyonc\u00e9 playing the character Nala, the film features James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Keegan Michael-Key (Kamari), Donald Glover (Simba) and more. To promote it, Glover appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live yesterday in a lion onesie \u2014 and confessed he had trouble singing in the same room as Beyonc\u00e9. \"I requested not to be,\" Glover laughed, \"I did not want to be looking into Beyonc\u00e9's eyes while doing this.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

The film's theme song, performed by Parton, took on a life of its own. 20th Century Fox/Getty Images hide caption Dolly Parton in a scene from the 1980 comedy 9 to 5. The film's theme song, performed by Parton, took on a life of its own. This story is part of American Anthem, a yearlong series on songs that rouse, unite, celebrate and call to action. Find more at NPR.org/Anthem. This year at the Grammy Awards, backed by a chorus of contemporary Nashville stars, Dolly Parton brought the house down with a song older than most of the performers onstage. It's the same song Elizabeth Warren walked out to when she announced her presidential run in February. The story of that song begins decades ago, behind a desk. \"It was the kind of job where you were just not seen.\" Karen Nussbaum has spent most of her career as a labor leader and organizer, but she started in the early 1970s as an office worker, in a job she says she does not remember fondly. \"You were just part of the wallpaper,\" she says. \"I remember sitting at my desk one day and a student came in \u2014 I worked at a university \u2014 and looked me dead in the eye and said, 'Isn't anybody here?' It was those kinds of things that just got under your skin a lot.\" Nussbaum and some friends got together to talk about their frustrations. The result was a new organization with the mission of supporting women in the workplace, which they called 9to5. When their story made its way to Jane Fonda, whom Nussbaum knew through the antiwar movement, it helped inspire something else: A movie starring Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton as three fed-up working women, with Dabney Coleman as their insufferable boss. 9 to 5 was a revenge fantasy for women who felt overworked, underpaid and disrespected. The film hit No. 2 at the box office in 1980, beaten only by The Empire Strikes Back. But its original theme song, written and performed by Parton, had a life of its own, reaching No. 1 on three different Billboard charts and earning an Oscar nomination. It begins with a sound like a typewriter, which Parton happened on by clicking her fingernails. \"I think the song is brilliant,\" Nussbaum says. \"It starts with pride: 'Pour myself a cup of ambition.' It goes to grievances: 'Barely getting by.' It then goes to class conflict: 'You're just a step on the bossman's ladder.' And then it ends with collective power: 'In the same boat with a lot of your friends.' So in the space of this wildly popular song with a great beat, Dolly Parton just puts it all together by herself.\" Rebecca Traister, a New York magazine writer who comments frequently on feminism and politics (her most recent book, Good and Mad, is about the power of women's anger), says the song had a similar effect on her when she worked as an administrative assistant. Though the song was more than 20 years old by then, she and her friends would still sing along to it on the local bar's jukebox when work left them stressed out and feeling stuck. \"It's a song that contains complaints about so many frustrations and inequities and injustices within a workplace \u2014 some of them gendered, some of them capitalist, some of them about how power is so unequally distributed,\" Traister says. \"It is simultaneously a song of angry complaint and immense good cheer. And there is something about that combination that makes it kind of addictive and fun.\" A different take on the song emerged last spring, when This American Life commissioned Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards to record a cover of \"9 to 5\" for an episode dealing with workplace harassment. Garbus, who was a secretary, cleaned houses and stocked grocery shelves on her way to a music career, says Parton's lyrics capture so much about the reality of workers' daily lives \u2014 and their dreams. \"How much dreaming it takes to get through some of those days, some of those miserable days that feel dehumanizing, cleaning up other peoples' messes and generally being treated like trash, how much dreaming is needed in those times to get up the next morning and do it all again,\" she says. Garbus' version of the song ends abruptly on the line \"It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it,\" leaving things on a far more pointed note than the original. \"I felt like I didn't want to be cute with it,\" she explains. \"I wanted it to end with a period, exclamation point, question mark.\" Whether one is ending it with a question mark, belting it out in a bar, organizing labor or running for president \"9 to 5\" is a song that pretty much anyone who's ever had to work for a living can relate to \u2014 especially women.

Kim Davey/Facebook hide caption Kim Davey (left), a passenger in Menzi Mngoma's Uber, made a video of his in-car opera singing that went viral. When Menzi Mngoma decided to get a job as an Uber driver, it was mostly out of necessity. The 27-year-old has a fianc\u00e9, kids and his parents to support, and his life's passion, opera, wasn't paying the bills. But he was also making a bet. \"You need to be well-connected to go overseas,\" he told NPR. Though he's currently based in Durban, South Africa, Mngoma dreams of becoming an international musical sensation; he thought that driving Uber might help him make connections with people who could further his career. After more than a year, the bet finally paid off for Mngoma. In late May, he was driving a woman from Johannesburg named Kim Davey while she was in Durban for a business trip. \"From the moment I started chatting to Menzi in the Uber, I just knew he was a kind and special soul,\" Davey says. They got to talking, and Mngoma revealed he is an opera singer. Davey asked him to sing; he complied with several arias. The videos she took of his performance, showcasing his lyric tenor, have since racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook. And how talented is he? Tim Ashley, opera critic for the Guardian, wrote that Mngoma sang \"perfectly decently and with no strain at the top [of the voice].\" The exposure has rocketed Mngoma to semi-stardom. He has since been interviewed by radio and TV stations across the country and auditioned for the Cape Town Opera. He has even been invited to participate in iPop, an international talent contest in L.A. this December \u2014 a step toward his dream of international stardom. Mngoma says he always stuck out a little in his hometown of Richards Bay, a seaside community near Durban with a high unemployment and poverty rate (though his family wasn't very poor, he says, they were also far from wealthy). While other boys played soccer, he'd be cooking or cleaning or spending time looking at sheet music and playing DVDs to learn about different musical styles. He says he's been singing since \"I knew myself\" and turned to opera when he was 14. \"It [made] me feel so unique around my age group,\" he says. \"Most people listened to R&B.\" His friends called him Pavarotti after the famed Italian tenor. It's fitting, then, that Mngoma's favorite aria is one that Pavarotti and many other tenors have recorded from Verdi's La Traviata. When he first performed it in high school, his music teachers were impressed, he recalls. \"For a very young guy like me in grade 8, [they were] surprised \u2014 I can go to every range, I can pronounce the Italian in the way that I did,\" he says. Mngoma says he's always been a hard worker when it comes to singing, sometimes too much so. He says he failed a term in high school because he was always sneaking away from class to sing. He's taught himself but also taken lessons. He says he practices about 2 hours a day four times a week. After high school, Mngoma moved to Durban in 2011. He sang in choirs and landed some roles in operas. But his various gigs didn't add up to a living. Before he drove an Uber he taught singing at a primary school. Mngoma still hasn't been able to quit his day job. But he believes his future as a full-time performer might not be too far off. On Friday, Mngoma put out his first single, \"Feel the Love,\" which he calls \"pop-era\" \u2014 a mix of pop and opera. East Coast Radio arranged for Davey to fly down from Johannesburg and surprise Mngoma in studio. The two, who've become close friends, hugged fiercely. \"His reaction was priceless,\" she says. You can preview the song here. And even though it's definitely not opera, Mngoma is just happy to be singing for a worldwide audience. Susie Neilson is an intern on NPR's Science Desk.

        "title": "Johnny Clegg, A Uniting Voice Against Apartheid, Dies At 66 : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: One of the most celebrated voices in modern South African music has died. Singer, dancer and activist, Johnny Clegg co-founded two groundbreaking, racially mixed bands during the apartheid era. And he took their music to fans around the world. Johnny Clegg died Tuesday at a family home in Johannesburg after a years-long struggle with cancer. He was 66. NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas has this remembrance. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ASIMBONANGA\") JOHNNY CLEGG: (Singing in Zulu). ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: Johnny Clegg wrote his 1987 song \"Asimbonanga\" for Nelson Mandela while the future president was still in prison. It became an anthem for South Africa's freedom fighters. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ASIMBONANGA\") CLEGG: (Singing) Oh, the sea is cold and the sky is grey. Look across the island into the bay. TSIOULCAS: Clegg was born in England, but he became one of South Africa's most creative and outspoken cultural figures. He discovered the country's music when he was a young teenager in Johannesburg, as he told NPR in 2017. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CLEGG: I stumbled on Zulu street guitar music being performed by Zulu migrant workers, traditional tribesmen from the rural areas. And they developed a totally unique genre of guitar music, indigenous to South Africa. And I found it quite emancipating. TSIOULCAS: He'd been studying classical guitar, but he found a local black teacher who took him into neighborhoods where whites weren't supposed to go. Because he was so young, he was accepted. And in those neighborhoods, he discovered his other great passion - the warlike movements of Zulu dance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CLEGG: Which were pretty powerful for a young, 16-year-old adolescent boy. They knew something about being a man, which they could communicate physically in the way that they danced and carried themselves. And I wanted to be able to do the same thing. Basically, I wanted to become a Zulu warrior. And in a very deep sense, it offered me an African identity. TSIOULCAS: And even though he was white, he was welcomed into their ranks, despite the dangers to both him and his mentors. He was arrested multiple times for breaking the segregation laws. Yet, he continued to go back. And it was through his dance team that he met one of his longest musical collaborators. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CLEGG: I met Sipho Mchunu and we played for about six, seven years - traditional maskanda guitar music. We couldn't play in public, so we played in private venues - schools, churches, university. We played a lot of embassies. We played a lot of consulates. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IMPI\") JULUKA: (Singing in Zulu). TSIOULCAS: Clegg wanted to try to meld Zulu music with Celtic folk and rock. So they founded a band called Juluka, which means sweat in Zulu. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IMPI\") JULUKA: (Singing in Zulu). TSIOULCAS: At the time, Johnny was a professor of anthropology. Sipho was working as a gardener. They landed a record deal. And while they couldn't get airplay or perform publicly in South Africa, the band still managed to find an audience. And one of its songs became a hit in the UK. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SCATTERLINGS OF AFRICA\") JULUKA: (Singing) They are the scatterlings of Africa, each uprooted one on the road to Phelamanga, where the world began. TSIOULCAS: The band toured internationally for several years but eventually broke up. So Clegg founded a new group, Savuka, meaning we have risen in Zulu. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CLEGG: Savuka was launched, basically, in the state of emergency in South Africa in 1986. You could not ignore what was going on. The entire Savuka project was based in the South African experience and the fight for a better quality of life and freedom for all. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONE MAN ONE VOTE\") SAVUKA: (Singing) One man, one vote. Step into the future. One man, one vote in a unitary state. TSIOULCAS: Nelson Mandela eventually danced on stage with Savuka, and Clegg went on to a solo career. But in 2017, he announced he'd been fighting cancer and launched one final tour. (SOUNDBITE OF FRIENDS OF JOHNNY CLEGG SONG, \"THE CROSSING\") TSIOULCAS: The following year, dozens of high-profile musicians recorded one of Clegg's songs to honor him and benefit primary school education in South Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE CROSSING\") FRIENDS OF JOHNNY CLEGG: (Singing in Zulu) I'm coming. (Singing in Zulu) I'm coming. (Singing in Zulu) Even though the tide is turning... TSIOULCAS: Clegg never shied away from being described as a crossover artist. He embraced the concept. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CLEGG: I love it. I love the hybridization of culture, language, music, dance. If we look at the history of art, generally speaking, it is through the interaction of different communities, cultures, worldviews, ideas, concepts that invigorates styles and genres and gives them life, and gives people a different angle on stuff that was really just, you know, being passed down blindly from generation to generation. TSIOULCAS: Johnny Clegg didn't do anything blindly. Instead, he held a mirror up to his nation and urged South Africa to redefine itself. Anastasia Tsioulcas, NPR News, New York.

The video features delicate, sparsely-colored artwork and animation from Douglas Miller. Shelley says the album overall \"is built as a haven for overstimulated heads in uncertain times. ...Whether it be a physical place or an idea, everyone needs a place of comfort. One where we can look out again from that place of calm and see how to best act and to be in an uncertain world.\" Though Shelley recorded Like the River Loves the Sea far from her native Kentucky in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, she says she stayed close to the \"many musical traditions that comprise what we now call Kentucky music,\" the core sound on her previous recordings. This is her first full-length release in two years, following her 2017 self-titled album and 2018 EP Rivers and Vessels. Like the River Loves the Sea is out Aug. 30 on No Quarter Records.

Annabel Mehran/Courtesy of the artist hide caption Wilco has announced it'll release the band's 11th studio album later this year. Drawing its title from the poetry of Friedrich Schiller \u2014 and Beethoven's Ninth symphony \u2014 Wilco's Ode to Joy will feature what frontman Jeff Tweedy calls \"really big, big folk songs,\" including the album's first single, \"Love is Everywhere (Beware).\" \"Right now I'm frightened how love is here,\" sings Tweedy over wistfully arpeggiated guitars. \"Beware / Our love is everywhere.\" It's both an affirmation of love's enduring power and a warning that it could be undermined at any moment. Tweedy says the album overall is defiantly joyful in the face of global political and cultural upheaval. \"The record is, in a weird way, an ode,\" he says in a statement announcing the album. \"This terrible stuff is happening, this deepening sense of creeping authoritarianism that weighs on everybody's psyche on a daily basis, and you're allowed to feel a lot of things at once. And one thing that is worth feeling, that is worth fighting for, is your freedom to still have joy even though things are going to s***.\" Ode to Joy arrives during a particularly prolific creative period for Tweedy. In the last five years he's released three solo albums (Together at Last, Warm and Warmer), two more Wilco records (Star Wars and Schmilco) an album with his son under the name Tweedy (Sukierae) and wrote and produced the album If All I Was Was Black with Mavis Staples. Last year he also published his memoir, Let's Go (So We Can Get Back). Ode to Joy is due out Oct. 4 on dBpm Records. Artwork and full track list below: 1. Bright Leaves2. Before Us3.

        "title": "Nicki Minaj Cancels Saudi Arabia Performance : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Nicki Minaj is one of hip-hop's most provocative artists. So it was surprising that she was invited to perform at a music festival in Saudi Arabia. It's one of the world's most conservative countries, a place where no women were allowed to give public concerts until two years ago. Minaj accepted the invitation and was announced as the headliner last week. Then this afternoon, under heated criticism, Minaj pulled out. NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas joins us now to talk this over. Hey there. ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: OK. Let's start by just playing a clean version of one of Nicki Minaj's songs and imagine this being performed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ANACONDA\") NICKI MINAJ: (Rapping) Bang, bang, bang, I let him hit it 'cause he hang, hang, hang. All in the salad like his name Romaine. And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain... SHAPIRO: Anastasia, how was this supposed to go over? TSIOULCAS: That's a really good question and I guess one that we don't have to quite answer (laughter) Ari, now that it's not happening. But it's really hard to imagine an artist like Nicki Minaj to be in a place like Jeddah. You know, there have been other foreign artists who have performed in the kingdom in the last couple of years, people like Mariah Carey and Enrique Iglesias and the Backstreet Boys, but Nicki Minaj, that's something else altogether. SHAPIRO: Right. And so then this afternoon, she told the Associated Press that she's not going. What happened between the time she accepted and now? TSIOULCAS: Well, she had been invited to perform at this festival called the Jeddah World Fast. And you're right. She was the headliner, but she was along some other big names, too, like the DJ Steve Aoki and Liam Payne, who used to be in the boy band One Direction. But activists, including the Human Rights Foundation, had been urging her and other artists to cancel given the Saudi leadership's stance on things like human rights and freedom of speech and women's rights. And so just this afternoon, she said, quote, \"after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.\" SHAPIRO: This is a country where women are required to cover up in public, where many businesses are segregated by gender, where people who speak critically of the regime, including journalist Jamal Khashoggi, have been killed. So why would they have invited somebody as unapologetically explicit and sexual as Nicki Minaj in the first place? TSIOULCAS: Well, she is undoubtedly popular across the globe. And only until a couple of years ago, no artists were allowed to perform in the capital city, in Riyadh. And the Saudi leadership at the same time knows that its citizens regularly go abroad to places like the Emirates to hear concerts and see movies and do the things they can't do at home. And about three years ago, the Saudi government announced these plans to diversify its economy away from oil, and building entertainment at home was one of those strategies. But it's still Saudi Arabia, so alcohol and drugs are banned. And any woman attending the concert is, of course, expected to cover themselves wearing a full-length abaya, and many Saudi women choose to veil their faces as well. So it's a real disparity between what could have been happening on stage and what it looked like in the audience. SHAPIRO: So do you see all of this as an effort by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to wipe away some of the very public criticism of his regime's human rights abuses and change the subject to talk about entertainment instead? TSIOULCAS: That could definitely be a factor, Ari, especially as you mentioned the killing of Khashoggi, and a music festival could be an attempt to soften the country's outward-facing image. They're planning to broadcast the festival internationally and even make visas more accessible for foreigners who want to go to this music festival. But I think it's also been an attempt to soften the image of the Saudi government for people inside of Saudi Arabia as well. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas. Thank you. TSIOULCAS: Pleasure to be here. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SUPER BASS\") MINAJ: (Singing) Boy, you got my heartbeat runnin' away. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

On this episode of All Songs Considered we've got a conversation with GoldLink about his latest album, Diaspora. (Hear the full interview with the play button at the top of the page). GoldLink has never been satisfied with just one sound. Since his breakout mixtape, 2013's The God Complex, the DMV rapper \u2014 that's Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia \u2014 created a dedicated online community during his mixtapes days by weaving together go-go, house, R&B and boom-bap. His fearless and wily disregard for genre rules caught the attention of producers like Rick Rubin and Kaytranada, and his 2016 single \"Crew,\" featuring DMV contemporaries Shy Glizzy and Brent Faiyaz, earned 'Link a Grammy nomination for Best Rap/Sung Performance \u2014 not to mention becoming an unofficial anthem for his hometown. Now, GoldLink goes global. Diaspora, his debut album on RCA Records, blends together Afrobeat, juju, bossa nova, reggae and so much more. It's all to create what GoldLink calls the decentralized future of music. Diaspora Courtesy of the artist hide caption The 26-year-old pulled collaborators from different diaspora \u2014 from Congolese artist Antonio \"Zapaterro StrongMan\" Nvuala on \"Zulu Screams\" to Hong Kong rapper Jackson Wang on \"Rumble\" \u2014 to give Diaspora its border-jumping feel. But he still made sure to give DMV-hailing staples Lil Nei, Bibi Bourelly and Pusha T time to shine. \"If you want to make a diaspora of things, you need to reach to a diaspora of people,\" he says. GoldLink joined All Songs Considered from the BBC in London to discuss the new music, rapid gentrification in D.C. and what he's learned about the universal black experience. \"Black people in Amsterdam or aboriginal people from Australia or black people from D.C., we don't know that we all have the same upbringing,\" he says. \"That maybe all our aunts have plastic on their couches or maybe we all have that grandma in the neighborhood. That actually happens everywhere.\" Tom Huizenga produced this episode for air. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Nicki Minaj has cancelled her performance in Saudi Arabia due to pressure from human rights activists. Nicki Minaj is known as one of hip-hop's most provocative artists. So it was surprising when she was offered, and that she accepted, the opportunity to headline a July music festival in Saudi Arabia \u2014 one of the world's most conservative countries, and one in which no women were permitted to give public concerts until two years ago. Now, after facing heated criticism from human rights groups, Minaj has pulled out of the July 18 event, citing her commitment to women's rights, the LGBTQ community, and freedom of expression. She was slated to headline the Jeddah World Fest in Jeddah, a city of 4 million that sits on the Red Sea. Other festival headliners include EDM star Steve Aoki and former One Direction singer Liam Payne. Since her booking at the festival was announced on July 3, various activists, including the Human Rights Foundation, called for her and the other artists to cancel due to the Saudi leadership's widely condemned sociopolitical policies. Minaj gave a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday explaining why she had withdrawn from the festival. \"After better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community, and freedom of expression,\" Minaj said. Saudi Arabia is a country where women are required to cover up in public, where many businesses are segregated by gender, and where people who speak critically of the regime \u2014 including journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 have been killed. So why would Saudi Arabia invite an artist as unapologetically explicit and sexual as Nicki Minaj to headline a festival in its second-largest city? The answer is likely economic interests. About three years ago, the Saudi government announced big plans to diversify its economy away from oil \u2014 and building up its entertainment options at home was one explicit strategy. Saudi citizens regularly travel abroad \u2014 to the Emirates, for example \u2014 to see concerts, movies and other forms of entertainment. A concern for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's public image, on both a national and an international scale, may also lie behind the festival and its high-profile headliners \u2014 especially in the aftermath of Khashoggi's death. The organizers plan to broadcast the festival internationally, and to make visas accessible for foreigners to attend the Jeddah World Fest. No other scheduled artists have yet withdrawn from the festival, but with the stance that Nicki Minaj has taken, that may change. Listen to the full aired interview through the audio link.

Alysse Gafkjen/Courtesy of the artist hide caption The Highwomen, left to right: Natalie Hemby, Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris and Amanda Shires. In 1985, a team of country-music legends formed The Highwaymen, a supergroup combining the talents of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. It somehow took 34 years for someone to think of a perfectly named counterpart, but now we've got The Highwomen, featuring Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris, Amanda Shires and Nashville songwriting force Natalie Hemby. The new band, which announced its existence just a few months ago, will release its self-titled, Dave Cobb-produced debut album on Sept. 6. Today, it's launched its first single and video, \"Redesigning Women.\" Directed by Elizabeth Olmstead, the video mixes footage of The Highwomen's stars with a delightful mix of country-music legends (Tanya Tucker! Wynonna Judd!) and up-and-comers (Cam! Erin Rae!). The album follows in a similar collaborative spirit, with guest contributions from Sheryl Crow, Jason Isbell, Lori McKenna, Miranda Lambert, Ray LaMontagne and more. \"Anyone can be a Highwoman,\" Carlile says in the band's press materials. \"It's about banding together, abandoning as much ego as humanly possible, holding one another up and amplifying other women every chance we get. Shoulder to shoulder. One push, one love.\" The Highwomen comes out Sept. 26 via Low Country Sound/Elektra. The group will make its live concert debut at the Newport Folk Festival on July 26.

Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images hide caption Thom Yorke's third solo album ANIMA represents a recalibration of his creative process. In his vast catalog of music, Radiohead's Thom Yorke has trembled like a broken man on his knees. He has screamed in tormented six-part harmony; he has manic-whispered diaries worth of existential fear. Still, he just can't shake the techno-dread. Most recently, that dread has manifested in Yorke's third solo project, ANIMA, released on June 27. ANIMA is a nine-song album accompanied by a short \"one-reel\" Netflix film set in an Orwellian urban dystopia from director Paul Thomas Anderson. The projectfinds new ways to dig into Yorke's old anxieties and represents his most harrowing solo work to date. Ever since Radiohead put out the visionary OK Computer in 1997, Yorke has artfully expressed his misgivings about technology and its potential to fray social fabric. By now, you'd think, he might have exhausted the theme. But with the dreamlike atmospheres of ANIMA, he opens up another zone of exploration. Yorke is not one to repeat himself, however. ANIMA represents a recalibration of his creative process. Like his previous solo efforts and his vivid score to the 2018 film Suspiria, it's built on the orderly loops of electronic dance music. But the scale is different: He's not making big pronouncements about the culture. Instead he's sharing bits of a personal reckoning. The songs unfold fitfully and don't always follow conventional verse-chorus-hook structure. Yorke has cited the jump-cut collages of LA producer Flying Lotus as a direct inspiration. A simmering sense of menace runs through the album's music. It comes from the locust-like drones, the not-quite-steady clicking of simulated cymbals and the blurry, indecipherable chants that could be rituals from long-lost religions. ANIMA has been streaming for a since June 27 but CDs and vinyl versions of the record are out starting on July 19. In that time it's hit me in different ways. At first, the tone felt awfully familiar. Then, in headphones, it was easy to immerse in the dreamlike atmospheres \u2013 and impossible to miss the intimate menace lurking within them. That seems to be Yorke's approach with ANIMA: Rather than talk at length about existential terror, he's embedded the feeling deep into the tracks where it's inescapable.

On Thursday, federal prosecutors said an additional criminal prosecution against Kelly has been launched. Amr Alfiky/AP hide caption This June photo of R. Kelly shows him departing a courtroom in Chicago in a case related to a state sexual abuse case. On Thursday, federal prosecutors said an additional criminal prosecution against Kelly has been launched. Updated at 1:44 p.m. ET Saturday Federal prosecutors in New York and Chicago unsealed sweeping charges against R&B singer R. Kelly on Friday, accusing him of abusing women and girls for nearly two decades, including kidnapping, forced labor and sending child pornography across state lines. The bombshell indictments, the first federal criminal charges against Kelly, come a day after he was arrested while walking his dog outside his home in Chicago's Trump Tower. He faces a total of 18 federal counts. Kelly, who is already fighting sexual assault charges in Illinois state court as well as activity in multiple ongoing civil cases, is now confronting a complicated legal entanglement, facing three possible criminal trials following federal authorities dropping the new indictments Friday. In Northern District of Illinois, the indictment contains allegations of child pornography and obstruction of justice for allegedly making hush-money payments to silence the victims. Those charges involve five minors. Prosecutors say that beginning in about 1998, Kelly made sexual videos with several of the victims. Also charged in the Illinois indictment are two of Kelly's associates, Derrell McDavid, a manager of Kelly; and Milton \"June\" Brown, another Kelly employee. Prosecutors allege a conspiracy by Kelly to coverup evidence of sexual contact with minors. According to the charging documents, Kelly and his associates paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to collect copies of his child pornography videos, which had begun circulating. In addition, authorities say Kelly and others paid alleged victims, their parents, other family members and other witnesses to prevent them from testifying in court or otherwise coming forward. Those payoffs were said to include gifts and foreign travel as well as cash, and that Kelly also \"used physical abuse, violence, threats of violence, blackmail, and other controlling behaviors\" to silence his alleged victims. In the indictment unsealed Friday morning in New York, federal prosecutors charged Kelly with one count of racketeering related to kidnapping and four violations of the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for \"immoral purposes.\" Kelly allegedly abused five victims, including three minors, in incidents as far back as 1999 and as recently as 2018, the indictment alleges. Prosecutors say Kelly worked with his bodyguards, drivers and personal assistants to form an illegal conspiracy to find and abuse women and girls \"to engage in illegal sexual activity with Kelly,\" prosecutors wrote. \"By promoting R. Kelly's music and the R. Kelly brand, the members of the Enterprise expected to receive financial opportunities and personal benefits and increased power.\" Kelly and his entourage allegedly recruited and groomed women and girls, enticing them with access to the singer and promises of money. Authorities say he confined the victims against their will, forcing them to engage in sex acts and sometimes filming the sexual activity. Authorities say the women had to follow Kelly's strict rules, like not leaving a room without Kelly's permission, not looking at other men and calling Kelly \"Daddy.\" These incidents are alleged to have taken place in locations including Chicago, Connecticut, California and in Brooklyn, where prosecutors on Friday unsealed the charges. Darrell Johnson, a crisis manager who works as Kelly's publicist, held a spectacle of a press conference Friday in Atlanta in which he was continually interrupted by Timothy Savage, who is the father of Joycelyn Savage, a girlfriend of Kelly's. \"I want to know where my daughter is,\" Timothy Savage screamed at Johnson. \"Where is she at? Answer that question!\" Kelly will remain detained until a hearing on his detention Tuesday. Prosecutors have requested that Kelly be held in without bail while he awaits trial, saying he is a danger to the community and a significant flight risk. Kelly's accusers viewed Friday as a long-overdue day of reckoning, coming after decades in which Kelly has been dogged by accusations of child pornography and sexual contact with minors. He had previously been prosecuted by Illinois authorities in a child pornography case, but in June 2008 Kelly was acquitted of all charges. Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, released a statement Friday saying Kelly \"was aware of the investigations and the charges were not a surprise.\" In his statement, Greenberg repeated assertions that he has made previously in connection to the Cook County indictments: namely, that they involve decades-old allegations. \"They've charged him in New York with enticing people and encouraging people to have sex with him,\" Greenberg said. \"I don't think people accidentally have sex so I'm not really sure what the criminal activity is here.\" Please see the attached regarding R @rkelly pic.twitter.com/e9p5cJLnES In recent months, fresh interest has been generated around the longtime accusations against Kelly. An interview Kelly did with Gayle King in March in which he emotionally denied sexual misconduct prompted widespread attention. And Lifetime's recent six-episode Surviving R. Kelly documentary included accounts from several women who accused the singer of misconduct, drawing a new focus to the longstanding accusations lodged at him. More accusers began publicly telling their stories about alleged abuse and sexual misconduct perpetrated by him. State prosecutors in Chicago this year have filed sexual assault and abuse charges against him, the latest of which were filed six weeks ago. Kelly, 52, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has pleaded not guilty. Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents three of Kelly's alleged victims, said in a statement said Friday was an important day for Kelly's accusers. \"I am very proud of the courage of many of my clients who shared what they allege against Mr. Kelly with investigators and prosecutors,\" Allred said. \"Justice, which is long overdue for his victims, will soon be done.\" WBEZ's Patrick Smith and NPR's Colin Dwyer contributed to this report.

Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption R&B singer R. Kelly covers his mouth as he speaks to members of his entourage as he leaves the Leighton Criminal Courts Building following a hearing on June 26, 2019 in Chicago. Embattled R&B singer R. Kelly pleaded not guilty in a Chicago courtroom Tuesday to 13 federal charges, including child pornography and obstruction of justice. The indictment was one of two federal cases issued against the singer last week, one in Illinois and the other in New York. Federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois say that Kelly made substantial hush-money payments to silence the alleged victims \u2014 five girls \u2014 and members of their families. Despite a history of allegations that stretches over a quarter century, this is the first time that Kelly was charged with federal crimes. In addition to the Illinois federal indictment, federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York unsealed a separate, five-count indictment of Kelly last Friday. Those charges include one count of racketeering related to kidnapping and four violations of the Mann Act, which refers to transporting girls over state lines for sexual trafficking. There are five alleged victims in the New York indictment, including three girls. The alleged incidents referenced in the two federal indictments span 1998 to 2018. In total, the two federal indictments contain 18 counts, including child pornography, kidnapping, obstruction of justice and trafficking minors and women for sexual purposes. During Tuesday's court appearance, Judge Harry D. Leinenweber also decided that Kelly will remain in custody as he awaits trial in Chicago. According to the Chicago Tribune, he will be taken by U.S. marshalls to face the New York indictment in Brooklyn; the Chicago Sun-Times reports that he will be transferred to Brooklyn sometime before Sept. 4. Also charged in the Illinois indictment were two of Kelly's associates: his manager Derrell McDavid and an employee, Milton \"June\" Brown. Prosecutors say that Kelly and his associates paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to collect copies of his child pornography videos that had begun circulating. In addition, prosecutors assert Kelly and others in his circle paid out cash, substantial gifts and foreign travel to alleged victims, their parents, other family members and witnesses to prevent them from testifying in court or otherwise coming forward publicly. On Monday, celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti \u2014 who says that he represents three alleged victims of Kelly as well as six other people, ranging from parents of alleged victims to three Kelly associates whom Avenatti calls \"whistleblowers\" \u2014 claimed that Kelly paid out $2 million to keep the alleged victim in a 2008 criminal trial in Chicago from testifying. In that case, Kelly was accused of making child pornography with a teenage girl. Neither the girl nor her parents testified in the case, though multiple family members, friends and even a basketball coach identified her on the witness stand. In June 2008, Kelly was acquitted on all counts. Kelly also continues to face a range of criminal charges in Cook County, Ill., including aggravated criminal sexual assault and abuse.

In a country under strict Islamic law, suddenly, graffiti appeared on walls. Music of all kinds blasted from speakers. Men and women commingled openly at a protest camp in front of military headquarters. Standing as a stark example of these post-military crackdown changes is Capital FM \u2014 a popular music radio station that was at the center of the spring's cultural revolution. \"It was just so beautiful, and we were just so proud that we're soulful,\" Ahmad Hikmat, Capital FM's content director, says as he recalls the creativity that Capital exuded. \"You'd wake up in the morning, and you'd hear a song on Capital Radio was D'Angelo. Who would play D'Angelo in the morning, you know? It's just 91.6 FM that would do that.\" But the surge of cultural awakening ended when the military junta running the country violently broke up the protests in the capital city of Khartoum. Now, Capital FM, is fighting for survival. Now, as Hikmat walks through the empty station, the walls are bare. The sound panels have been taken down. You can still see the dabs of glue that held up vinyl records of Keith Sweat, Kenny Burke, Ray Charles and The Roots that decorated the studio. Pushing the envelop in a Islamist country, Capital FM had become a symbol for a modern Sudan. It started as a house music station and then became a cultural hub. They had even begun hosting parties with DJs and bands where young Sudanese could quite literally let their hair down. But since the militarization of Khartoum, government censors have been taking the station off the air for hours at a time. To Hikmat, this is a clear warning sign that soon, security forces will break down Capital FM's doors and confiscate everything \u2014 so he has started taking the place apart. \"It's a bit dark now at the moment, because we painted the walls black because of everything that is happening,\" Hikmat says. Pushing the envelop in a Islamist country, Capital FM had become a symbol for a modern Sudan. Now, the station's airwaves have gone almost silent. YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Pushing the envelop in a Islamist country, Capital FM had become a symbol for a modern Sudan. Now, the station's airwaves have gone almost silent. Hikmat says that one of his main jobs at Capital is to keep what it represents \u2014 a utopia of progressiveness \u2014 intact. Recently, that has been a particularly difficult task. One Capital FM staffer was killed at the protest camp, and many others question whether an enterprise like Capital is even possible in Sudan at this point. \"I'm trying to keep hope because everyone is leaving,\" he says. \"I am losing my team one by one.\" To express what he feels in respect to the situation at Capital FM and in Khartoum, Hikmat says Marvin Gaye's \"Make Me Wanna Holler\" never leaves his mind. \"For me, this is the song that plays in my mind when I am driving in the streets, just looking at the leftovers,\" Hikmat says. \"I see those guys, you know, sitting there, chilling with their big-a** guns, and this song just plays in my head.\" Listen to the full aired story through the audio link.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The version of \"The Lion King\" that's out today features photo-realistic animals and celebrity voices. There's Beyonce, John Oliver, Donald Glover. There are also some things familiar to fans of the original Disney film. Composer Hans Zimmer won an Oscar for that score. He has returned to Pride Rock, and as Tim Greiving reports, he's brought along collaborators new and old. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CIRCLE OF LIFE\") LEBO M: (Chanting in foreign language). TIM GREIVING, BYLINE: That's South African musician Lebo M. singing the iconic proclamation that opened the original \"Lion King\" in 1994. LEBO M: I didn't even know anything about the movie. I just knew that it's something to do with conflict between a father and a brother that has a son in it - no detail. GREIVING: Composer Hans Zimmer called on Lebo M. to help bring some cultural authenticity to this animated movie about lions. LEBO M: I noticed the image of Mufasa. And my entire system went to, what happens when a important person in my country, my culture walks in? What happens when a king walks in? The musicality of my thought became (speaking foreign language) - then it translates to all hail the king. All bow down in the presence of the king. GREIVING: Lebo M. fled apartheid-era South Africa in 1979 when he was 16. He eventually moved to LA in hopes of being a superstar but ended up living on skid row. A few years later, he was working as a coffee gofer for a music producer, which is where he met Zimmer. \"The Lion King\" felt personal. LEBO M: I am the Simba, at this point, who grows up in exile. I don't go back home to take over the country, but I go back home a professional. And Mufasa, to me, becomes immediately the image of Nelson Mandela. GREIVING: Heavy subtext for a Disney cartoon, but there's a seriousness that anchors the whole score. (SOUNDBITE OF HANS ZIMMER'S \"REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE\") GREIVING: Hans Zimmer, who is best known for grown-up movies like \"Rain Man\" and \"Backdraft,\" originally took the job for two reasons. HANS ZIMMER: I didn't like Disney musicals. And then they were going, great, that's exactly what we want. We don't want somebody who wants to do what we did before. GREIVING: The other reason? His little girl. ZIMMER: It wasn't for my daughter. It was for her dad because every dad wants to show off. I thought, oh, no, this will be good. It'll be a cartoon. It'll be funny. It'll be harmless. It's about fuzzy animals. And I didn't realize it was profoundly going to go and hit me in a really hard way because my dad died when I was 6 years old, which was her age. GREIVING: In \"The Lion King,\" Mufasa, the king of Pride Rock, tragically dies saving his son Simba from a wildebeest stampede. The rest of the movie is about how Simba deals with that. ZIMMER: There I was, and the only way I could go and write the score was to open those deep and dark boxes and let all the darkness out. (SOUNDBITE OF HANS ZIMMER'S \"MUFASA DIES\") ZIMMER: Don't ever talk down to the children, they'll catch you at it. Be sincere. Be absolutely genuine. Be absolutely legitimate about this. Let's not make things easier. Let's not be funny for, like, the wrong reasons. At the same time, you know, the genius of the film is that you go from death of the father to fart jokes. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE LION KING\") NATHAN LANE: (As Timon) Pumbaa, not in front of the kids. ERNIE SABELLA: (As Pumbaa) Oh, sorry. GREIVING: Zimmer won his first and only Oscar for that score. When Disney asked him to score the hyper-realistic remake, he knew he wanted a fresh musical justification. That's when he saw a video online of the Re-Collective Orchestra, a new all-black orchestra co-founded by Stephanie Matthews. They formed last year to record their own arrangement of the Kendrick Lamar and Sza track \"All The Stars\" from \"Black Panther.\" (SOUNDBITE OF RE-COLLECTIVE ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE OF KENDRICK LAMAR AND SZA'S \"ALL THE STARS\") SZA: (Singing) All the stars are closer. All the stars are closer. All the stars are closer. STEPHANIE MATTHEWS: We were really inspired by \"Black Panther.\" And so when the film came out, we decided to kind of do a concept piece. What would the orchestra of Wakanda look like? GREIVING: Matthews as a session violinist and strings contractor, and she met Hans Zimmer in 2014 when she accompanied Pharrell Williams on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she was shocked when he emailed her saying he'd seen the video and wanted Re-Collective to play on the new \"Lion King.\" MATTHEWS: He was really, really passionate about the diversity and representation of having these musicians collaborate with the LA session musicians, who are extraordinary players, and just elevate the level of this project. GREIVING: Hans Zimmer's new \"Lion King\" score was recorded at Sony Studios in April. Many present, with decades between them, said it was the most diverse film-scoring session ever. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE\") UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing, unintelligible) ZIMMER: I was going for diversity. And then as soon as everybody started playing and sitting next to each other, it became this amazing thing which wasn't diversity at all. It was a unity. GREIVING: So even if you're fatigued by these endless remakes of classic Disney movies, it's hard to be mad when it sounds like this. For NPR News, I'm Tim Greiving. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

        "texts": "Felix Contreras Amid the most crucial political crisis to hit Puerto Rico in its modern history, three Puerto Rican musicians have released a protest song that is spreading across the island as fast as news of the next demonstration against the local government. \"Afilando Los Cuchillos\" (\"Sharpening The Knives\") was released on July 17 on YouTube by Residente from the iconic band Calle 13 featuring Benito Martinez Ocasio, the real name of Puerto Rican hip-hop star Bad Bunny as well as Ieana Cabra Joglar, who records as iLe and is the younger sister of Residente. As if creating a soundtrack to a resist movement in real time the musicians drew on a history of corruption and abuse on the island for inspiration as well as the intense fury building up in demonstrations this week. \"We're basically telling a story as if we were a newspaper but even better. More open, more direct and more raw,\" said Ileana Cabra Joglar in an interview from her home on the island. \"What we are saying is what we are seeing in the streets. We are telling a story of the moment we are in right now,\" iLe says. The song is a blistering, expletive-laden take down of Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and his administration delivered with the fury and energy that is fueling the massive demonstrations that have been taking place in the capital city of San Juan in response to leaked text messages between Rosello and others in his administration. According to NPR's Adrian Florido, the thread of the text conversations, which were published by the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico on July 13, contain evidence of homophobic, derogatory and misogynistic slurs as well as jokes about the dead bodies that were collected at a government facility before and after Hurricane Maria in September 2017. \"Vamos cortantes, como los cuchillos / Sacando chispa hasta llegar al filo / Hay que arrancar la maleza del plant\u00edo / Pa que ninguno se aproveche de lo m\u00edo,\" iLe sings during the emblazoned chorus. \"We are sharp, like knives / Sparkling up to the edge / Weed must be removed from the plantation / So that none of them take advantage of what is mine.\" Perez Joglar says the knife in the title is a metaphor to be used to cut through systemic corruption on the island. \"It's a very transcending moment for us here on the island,' says Perez Joglar. \"I think I have been waiting for this for a long time... I feel that Puerto Ricans are waking up and i think that is something that we needed a long time ago.

Jack Vartoogian/Getty Images hide caption South African musician Johnny Clegg, right, with his longtime bandmate Sipho Mchunu, performing in New York City in 1996. Clegg died Tuesday at age 66. One of the most celebrated voices in modern South African music has died. Singer, dancer and activist Johnny Clegg, who co-founded two groundbreaking, racially mixed bands during the apartheid era, died Tuesday in Johannesburg at age 66. He had battled pancreatic cancer since 2015. His death was announced by his manager and family spokesperson, Roddy Quin. Clegg wrote his 1987 song \"Asimbonanga\" for Nelson Mandela. It became an anthem for South Africa's freedom fighters. Johnny Clegg was born in England, but he became one of South Africa's most creative and outspoken cultural figures. He moved around a lot, as a white child born to an English man and a female jazz singer from Zimbabwe (then known as Southern Rhodesia). His parents split up while he was still a baby; Clegg's mother took him to Zimbabwe before she married again, this time to a South African crime reporter, when he was 7. The family moved north to Zambia for a couple of years, and then settled in Johannesburg. He discovered South Africa's music when he was a young teenager in Johannesburg. He had been studying classical guitar, but chafed under its strictness and formality. When he started hearing Zulu-style guitar, he was enchanted \u2014 and liberated. \"I stumbled on Zulu street guitar music being performed by Zulu migrant workers, traditional tribesmen from the rural areas,\" he told NPR in a 2017 interview. \"They had taken a Western instrument that had been developed over six, seven hundred years, and reconceptualized the tuning. They changed the strings around, they developed new styles of picking, they only use the first five frets of the guitar \u2014 they developed a totally unique genre of guitar music, indigenous to South Africa. I found it quite emancipating.\" He soon found a local, black teacher \u2014 who took him into neighborhoods where whites weren't supposed to go. He went to the migrant workers' hostels: difficult, dangerous places where a thousand or two young men at a time struggled to survive. But on the weekends, they kicked back, entertaining each other with Zulu songs and dances. Because Clegg was so young, he was accepted in their communities, and in those neighborhoods, he discovered his other great passion: Zulu dance, which he described as a kind of \"warrior theater\" with its martial-style movements of high kicks, ground stamps and pretend blows. \"The body was coded and wired \u2014 hard-wired \u2014 to carry messages about masculinity which were pretty powerful for a young, 16-year-old adolescent boy,\" he observed. \"They knew something about being a man, which they could communicate physically in the way that they danced and carried themselves. And I wanted to be able to do the same thing. I fell in love with it. Basically, I wanted to become a Zulu warrior. And in a very deep sense, it offered me an African identity.\" And even though he was white, he was welcomed into their ranks, despite the dangers to both him and his mentors. He was arrested multiple times for breaking the segregation laws. \"I got into trouble with the authorities, I was arrested for trespassing and for breaking the Group Areas Act,\" he told NPR. \"The police said, 'You're too young to charge. We're taking you back to your parents.'\" He persuaded his mother to let him go back. And it was through his dance team that he met one of his longest musical collaborators: Sipho Mchunu. As a duo, they played traditional maskanda guitar music for about six or seven years. \"We couldn't play in public,\" Clegg remembered, \"so we played in private venues, schools, churches, university private halls. We played a lot of embassies. We played a lot of consulates.\" Over time, they started thinking bigger; Clegg wanted to try to meld Zulu music with rock and with Celtic folk. \"I was exposed to Celtic folk music early on,\" he told NPR. \"I never knew my dad, and music was one way which I can connect with that country. I liked Irish, Scottish and English folk music. I had a lot of tapes and recordings of them. And my stepfather was a great fan of pipe music. On Sundays, he would play an LP of the Edinburgh Police Pipe Band.\" Clegg was sure that he heard connections between the rural music of South Africa's Natal province (now known as KwaZulu-Natal) \u2014 the music that he was learning from his black friends and teachers \u2014 and the sounds of Britain. So Clegg and Mchunu founded a fusion band called Juluka \u2014 \"Sweat\" in Zulu. At the time, Johnny was a professor of anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg; Sipho was working as a gardener. They dreamed of getting a record deal even though they knew they couldn't get airplay, or perform publicly in South Africa. It was a hard sell to labels. South African radio was strictly segregated, and record companies refused to believe that an album sung partly in Zulu and partly in English would find an audience in any case. Clegg told NPR that their songs' primary subject material wasn't setting off any sparks with record producers, either. \"You know, 'Who really cares about cattle? You're singing about cattle. You know we're in Johannesburg, dude, get your subject matter right!' Clegg recalled. \"But I was shaped by cattle culture, because all the songs I learned were about cattle, and I was interested. I was saying, 'There's a hidden world. And I'd like to put it on the table.'\" They got a record deal with producer Hilton Rosenthal, who released Juluka's debut album, Universal Men, on his own label, Rhythm Safari, in 1979. And the band managed to find an audience both at home and abroad. One of its songs, \"Scatterlings of Africa,\" became a chart hit in the U.K. The band toured internationally for several years, and went. But eventually, Mchunu decided he'd had enough. He wanted to go home \u2014 not just to Johannesburg, but home to his native region of Zululand, in the KwaZulu-Natal province, to raise cattle. \"It was really hard for Sipho,\" Clegg told NPR. \"He was a traditional tribesman. To be in New York City, he couldn't speak English that well \u2014 there were times when I think he felt he was on Mars. And after some grueling tours, he said to me, 'I gave myself 15 years to make it or break it in Joburg, and then go home.' So he resigned, and Juluka came to an end \u2014and I was still full of the fire of music and dance.\" So Clegg founded a new group called Savuka \u2014 which means \"We Have Risen\" in Zulu. Savuka had ardent love songs, like the swooning \"Dela,\" but many of the band's tunes, like \"One (Hu)Man, One Vote\" and \"Warsaw 1943 (I Never Betrayed the Revolution),\" were explicitly political. \"Savuka was launched basically in the state of emergency in South Africa, in 1986,\" Clegg observed. \"You could not ignore what was going on. The entire Savuka project was based in the South African experience and the fight for a better quality of life and freedom for all.\" Long after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and had become president of South Africa, he danced onstage with Savuka to that song that Clegg had written for him. Clegg went on to a solo career. But in 2017, he announced he'd been fighting cancer. And he made one last international tour that he called his \"Final Journey.\" The following year, dozens of musician friends and admirers \u2014 including Dave Matthews, Vusi Mahlasela, Peter Gabriel, and Mike Rutherford of Genesis \u2014 put together a charity single to honor Clegg. It's benefited primary school education in South Africa. Clegg never shied away from being described as a crossover artist. Instead, he embraced the concept. \"I love it,\" he said. \"I love the hybridization of culture, language, music, dance, choreography. If we look at the history of art, generally speaking, it is through the interaction of different communities, cultures, worldviews, ideas and concepts that invigorates styles and genres and gives them life and gives people a different angle on stuff that was really, just, you know, being passed down blindly from generation to generation.\" Johnny Clegg didn't do anything blindly. Instead, he held a mirror up to his nation \u2014 and urged South Africa to redefine itself. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Dolly Parton's '9 To 5' Is A Workers' Anthem Across Decades : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "(SOUNDBITE OF DOLLY PARTON SONG, \"9 TO 5\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Almost 40 years ago, Dolly Parton clicked her fingernails and came up with a sound that seemed a lot like a typewriter. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLLY PARTON SONG, \"9 TO 5\") MARTIN: That's how one of her most famous songs came to life. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") DOLLY PARTON: (Singing) Working 9 to 5. What a way to make a living, barely getting by. It's all taking and no giving. MARTIN: \"9 To 5\" was written for the movie of the same name, and it became an anthem for working women. It's still so popular that Elizabeth Warren plays it on the campaign trail. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: The next president of the United States of America, Senator Elizabeth Warren. (SOUNDBITE OF DOLLY PARTON SONG, \"9 TO 5\") MARTIN: As part of our series American Anthem, NPR's Lynn Neary explores how what seems like just a catchy pop song actually has some very powerful things to say about working life. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Longtime labor leader and organizer Karen Nussbaum started her career back in the early 1970s as an office worker. KAREN NUSSBAUM: It was a kind of job where you were just not seen. You were just part of the wallpaper. I remember sitting at my desk at lunch one day, and a student came in - I worked at a university - looked me dead in the eye and said, isn't anybody here? And it was those kinds of things that just got under your skin a lot. NEARY: Nussbaum and some of her friends got together to talk about their frustrations. That led to a new organization. It was called 9to5. Nussbaum knew Jane Fonda through the anti-war movement and told her about it. That inspired Fonda to make a movie starring herself, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton as three fed-up working women. Dabney Coleman played their insufferable boss. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"9 TO 5\") DABNEY COLEMAN: (As Franklin Hart Jr) Judy, you've got to help me. That mob has gone crazy out there. They're trying to kill me. JANE FONDA: (As Judy) Why would they want to do a nasty thing like that? COLEMAN: (As Franklin Hart Jr) I don't know. I'm not such a bad guy. FONDA: (As Judy) You're a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot. NEARY: The movie was the ultimate revenge fantasy for women who felt overworked, underpaid and disrespected. Dolly Parton wrote the song while working on the film. \"9 To 5\" was No. 2 the box office in 1980, beaten only by \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" The song was No. 1 on three different Billboard charts. Nussbaum says it's a perfect anthem for working women. NUSSBAUM: It starts with pride - pour yourself a cup of ambition. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") PARTON: (Singing) Tumble out of bed, and I stumble to the kitchen. Pour myself a cup of ambition, and yawn and stretch and try to come to life. NUSSBAUM: And then it goes to grievances - barely getting by, they always take the credit. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") PARTON: (Singing) They just use your mind, and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy, if you let it. NUSSBAUM: It then goes to class conflict - you're just a step on the boss man's ladder. And then it ends with collective power - you're in the same boat with a lot of your friends. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") PARTON: (Singing) In the same boat with a lot of your friends. Waiting for the day your ship will come in, and the tide's going to turn and it's all going to roll you away. NUSSBAUM: So in the space of this wildly popular song with a great beat, Dolly Parton just puts it all together, all by herself. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") PARTON: (Singing) Nine to five, for service and devotion. You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion. NEARY: More than 20 years after \"9 To 5\" first came out, Rebecca Traister was starting her career. Traister's a New York magazine writer who comments frequently on feminism and politics. Her most recent book, \"Good And Mad,\" is about the power of women's anger. But back then she had a job as an assistant, which she says was just another name for a secretary. REBECCA TRAISTER: It was a lot of getting coffee and making appointments and Xeroxing. NEARY: Traister and her friends found their jobs frustrating and stressful. They had ambitions for the future but feared getting stuck. Sometimes they were just plain angry. They'd like to get together for a drink at a local bar where \"9 To 5\" was on the jukebox. TRAISTER: We'd be sitting around tables drinking beer and talking, and everybody would pound their fists on the table or pound their nails. You know, there's the sound of the typing in the back of that song, the click, click, click, click, click, click? And, you know, we'd sing it. And it was - at that point, it was a 20, 25-year-old song. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"61ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS\") PARTON: Anybody out there work a 9-to-5 job? (APPLAUSE) PARTON: You can help us out on this one. NEARY: Fast-forward another 20-something years to the 2019 Grammys, and Dolly Parton brought down the house with a chorus of famous young singers, including Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, belting out her famous song. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"61ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS\") PARTON: (Singing) I want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me. I swear sometimes that man is out to get me. NEARY: There's a reason \"9 To 5\" has such staying power, says Rebecca Traister. TRAISTER: It's a song that contains complaints about so many frustrations and inequities and injustices within a workplace, some of them gendered, some of them capitalist, some of them about how power is so unequally distributed. It is a song that is simultaneously a song of angry complaint and immense good cheer. And there's something about that combination that makes it kind of addictive and fun. (SOUNDBITE OF TUNE-YARDS SONG, \"9 TO 5\") NEARY: A different take on the song emerged when the public radio program This American Life commissioned a new cover. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") TUNE-YARDS: (Singing) Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen, pour myself a cup of ambition. NEARY: Merrill Garbus, lead singer of Tune-Yards, says she wanted to bring a new sensibility to the song. MERRILL GARBUS: It is a great song because people can relate to feeling powerless. NEARY: Though she is now a successful singer, Garbus has worked a lot of jobs over the years. GARBUS: I shredded files. I restocked shelves at a grocery store. I was a secretary, a house cleaner. NEARY: Garbus says Parton's lyrics capture so much about the reality of workers' daily lives and their dreams. GARBUS: How much dreaming it takes to get through some of those days, some of those miserable days cleaning up other people's messes and generally being treated like trash. How much dreaming is needed in those times to get up the next morning and do it all again. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") TUNE-YARDS: (Singing) They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter. You're just a step on the boss man's ladder. But you got dreams he'll never take away. NEARY: Garbus' version of the song ends abruptly on a far more pointed note than the original. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") TUNE-YARDS: (Singing) It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it. GARBUS: I felt like I didn't want to be cutesy with it. I wanted to land with a period, exclamation point, question mark. (Laughter). NEARY: Whether ending it with a question mark, belting it out in a bar, organizing labor or running for president, \"9 To 5\" is a song that pretty much anyone who's ever had to work for a living can relate to, but especially women. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"9 TO 5\") PARTON: (Singing) It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "texts": "Emily Abshire The single art for the latest \"Old Town Road\" remix, which features Young Thug and Mason Ramsey alongside Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. Courtesy of the artist hide caption The single art for the latest \"Old Town Road\" remix, which features Young Thug and Mason Ramsey alongside Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. If you're an artist looking to break chart records in the streaming era, your best weapon might just be quantity. A viral curiosity turned story of the year, Lil Nas X's infectious and inescapable country-trap song \"Old Town Road\" has been untouched at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 15 weeks, just one week shy of the record for consecutive time in the No. 1 spot. If the 20-year-old rapper ties that record next week, he'll have done so at least partly by understanding one thing: In the current version of the chart system, it pays to release a song more than once. First launched on TikTok, the video platform where users respond to song-based viral challenges, \"Old Town Road\" entered the charts in March. When Billboard quietly removed it from its Hot Country Songs chart, claiming the song didn't embody enough elements of current country music, the resulting controversy boosted its profile. It surged to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and, fatefully, country rulebreaker Billy Ray Cyrus agreed to hop on an official remix. Alongside a winning social media presence, Lil Nas X has kept \"Old Town Road\" in conversation by repeating this trick: A remix by the producer Diplo dropped in late April, and last week came a version featuring Young Thug and the viral adolescent yodeler Mason Ramsey. That's four official versions of \"Old Town Road,\" each of which has been listened to millions of times. But on the Hot 100, you'll only find the song's name once. That's because Billboard counts remixes, as long as they meet certain parameters, as a single entity with the original song. \"It's case by case,\" says Billboard senior director of charts Gary Trust, who stressed he was speaking broadly about the decision process. \"But in general if it's similar in lyrics, music and production, they're rolled into one.\" Which means the combined hundreds of millions of listens from the four versions of \"Old Town Road,\" two of which add new verses by the featured artists, have all been pouring into the same bucket. Billboard charts have seen the power of the remix before: \"Despacito,\" which holds the current record for consecutive weeks at No. 1 (tied with the 1995 Mariah Carey / Boyz II Men power ballad \"One Sweet Day\"), was an international smash on its own, but a remix featuring Justin Bieber helped it take off in the U.S. Trust admits, though, that \"Old Town Road\" has pushed things to a new level. \"I think Lil Nas X is taking us a little bit further than what we usually see,\" he says. \"And good for him, he's being creative.\" But it seems his competition knows how to play the game, too. Billie Eilish, another young iconoclast breaking through in 2019, has been holding down the No. 2 spot with \"bad guy,\" and released her own remix last week featuring \u2014 who else \u2014 Justin Bieber. Numbers for the new \"bad guy\" haven't yet been rolled into the original on the Hot 100, but the track has already jumped above \"Old Town Road\" on the up-to-date radio chart. Monday's Hot 100 chart release will reveal if the addition of veteran chart-topper Bieber is enough to take down \"Old Town Road\" \u2014 but either way, there will be a compelling story to follow. If Lil Nas X stays at No. 1, his breakthrough single will have tied a record only two songs have reached before. If he doesn't, it will be because someone finally beat him \u2014 using the same tactic he's deployed so well. This remix race is just one example of artists adapting to changes in how Billboard's charts are calculated, the results of which can be disorienting. For now, Trust says Billboard doesn't see a need to change the remix policy, which was established two decades ago in response to a different Mariah Carey song, \"Fantasy,\" and its popular remixes \u2014 but is open to evolving as more challenges and exceptions arise. For now, he warns, a chart rivalry can always be disrupted. \"Sometimes it's not about what's been trending,\" he says. \"It's about what's going to come out in the next week.\" That could very well be yet another version of \"Old Town Road.\" Artists have been clamoring to propose their own versions \u2014 even Carey, who suggested a \"One Sweet Day\" mashup. Earlier this week, Lil Nas X publicly wondered if Dolly Parton and Megan Thee Stallion would join him on a remix; Wednesday night, Parton seemed to offer an enthusiastic response. \ud83d\udc34\ud83e\udd84 @LilNasX https://t.co/jD8WgNNNPI pic.twitter.com/WQWwW7sbi2 The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Once A Symbol Of Freedom, Sudan's Pop Radio Station Is Silent : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: When Omar al-Bashir was ousted back in April, there was an explosion of new culture in Sudan. In a country under Islamic law, suddenly, graffiti appeared on the walls, music of all kinds blasted from speakers and men and women commingled openly at a protest camp in front of military headquarters. But that ended when the military junta running the country violently broke up the protest. NPR's Eyder Peralta brings us the story of a radio station that was at the center of this cultural revolution that is now fighting for survival. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS) AHMAD HIKMAT: Second floor. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Ahmad Hikmat takes me up some stairs and into the center of Capital FM in Khartoum. HIKMAT: It's a bit dark now at the moment because we've painted the walls black because of everything that is happening. PERALTA: This used to be a place that was full of energy. Any musician, any artist who was experimenting in Sudan was welcome. HIKMAT: So this is the main studio. PERALTA: Hikmat, who is the content director here, looks around. The walls are bare. The sound panels are down. You can still see the dabs of glue that held up vinyl records that decorated the studios. They were of Keith Sweat, Keni Burke, Ray Charles, The Roots. HIKMAT: It was just so beautiful. And we were just so proud that we're soulful. And you'd wake up in the morning, you hear a song on Capital Radio that was D'Angelo. Who would play D'Angelo in the morning, you know? It's just 91.6 FM that would do that. PERALTA: Pushing the envelope in an Islamist country, Capital FM had become a symbol for a future, modern Sudan. It started as a house music station and then became a cultural hub. They had even begun hosting parties with DJs and bands where young Sudanese could quite literally let their hair down. But ever since the government militarized Khartoum, the government's censors have been taking the station off the air for hours at a time. To Hikmat, that is a clear warning that, soon, security forces will break down doors and confiscate everything. So he has started taking this place apart. HIKMAT: Equipments I had to hide, you know? I had my Mac, production PC - everything. Everything is just - it's not here. PERALTA: Hikmat says one of his main jobs was to keep this utopia of progressiveness intact. But these past few weeks, it's been tough. One staffer was killed at the protest camp, and many others are questioning whether a place like Capital is even possible in Sudan. HIKMAT: I'm trying to keep hope because everybody's leaving. Everybody - I'm losing my team one by one. PERALTA: He looks down. His smile is gone. I ask him if there's a single song that could express what he's feeling right now. And Ahmad Hikmat doesn't hesitate. HIKMAT: Yeah, I exactly know what - Marvin Gaye's \"Make Me Wanna Holler.\" PERALTA: He leaves the studio and walks fast to the control room. Are you going to play it on air? Can you actually do that? HIKMAT: I can actually do that. PERALTA: On the only computer left in the place, he presses a few buttons, and, bam. (SOUNDBITE OF MARVIN GAYE SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") HIKMAT: For me, this is the song that plays in my mind when I'm driving in the streets, just looking at the leftovers, and then I see those guys, you know, sitting there, chilling with their big-ass guns, and this song just plays in my head. (SOUNDBITE OF MARVIN GAYE SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") PERALTA: Marvin Gaye released this song in 1971. It's about being misunderstood, about how hard, how hopeless simply living can be in an unjust system. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") MARVIN GAYE: (Singing) Make me wanna holler - the way they do my life. Make me wanna holler - the way they do my life. This ain't living. This ain't living. PERALTA: Hikmat says he's trying not to lose hope. And as long as he can, he'll keep resisting, even if it's small, even if it's speaking truth through the soul of Marvin Gaye. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Khartoum. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") GAYE: (Singing) Bills pile up sky-high. Send that boy off to die. Oh, make me wanna holler - the way they do my life. Yeah, make me wanna holler - the way they do my life. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

        "title": "Thom Yorke's 'ANIMA' Digs Deeper Into His Dread Of Technology : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "AILSA CHANG, HOST: Radiohead's Thom Yorke has released a new solo album. It's called \"Anima.\" And it's accompanied by a short Netflix film of the same name. The album, just like the film, evokes an urban dystopia right out of a George Orwell story. Tom Moon reviewed the music and declared it Yorke's most harrowing solo work yet. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWIST\") THOM YORKE: (Vocalizing). TOM MOON, BYLINE: He's trembled like a broken man on his knees. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TWIST\") YORKE: (Singing) To you, who brought me back to life. MOON: He's screamed in anguished six-part harmony, manic-whispered whole diaries of existential fear. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TRAFFIC\") YORKE: (Singing) I can't breathe. I can't breathe. There's no water. There's no water. MOON: And still, Thom Yorke can't shake the techno dread. He was on it early. See Radiohead's visionary 1997 album \"OK Computer.\" And since then, he's built a catalogue of foreboding about technology, the effect it has on human interaction and its potential to corrode the soul. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I AM A VERY RUDE PERSON\") YORKE: (Singing) I have to hope this spell's going to break. I have to destroy to create. MOON: Yorke is not one to repeat himself, however. \"Anima\" represents a recalibration of his creative process. Like his previous solo efforts and his vivid score to the 2018 film \"Suspiria,\" it's built on the orderly loops of electronic dance music. But the scale is different. He's not making big pronouncements about the culture. Instead, he's sharing a personal reckoning. The songs unfold fitfully and don't always follow conventional verse-chorus-hook structure. Yorke says the jump cut collages of producer Flying Lotus were an inspiration. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE AXE\") YORKE: (Singing) I thought we had a deal. I thought we had a deal. I thought we had a deal. MOON: At times, these momentary episodes are disarmingly beautiful. On this tune, several Thom Yorkes are multi-tracked into a corral of despairing angels. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) YORKE: (Vocalizing). MOON: This record has been streaming for a couple of weeks now. Physical copies are out today with a bonus track. In that time, it's hit me in different ways. At first, the tone felt awfully familiar. Then, on headphones, it became easy to immerse in the dreamlike atmospheres and to notice the intimate menace lurking within them. That seems to be Yorke's approach with \"Anima.\" Rather than talk at length about existential terror, he's embedded the feeling of it deep into the tracks where it's inescapable. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IMPOSSIBLE KNOTS\") YORKE: (Singing) There's no room for mess. CHANG: The latest from Thom Yorke. It's called \"Anima.\" Our reviewer is Tom Moon. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IMPOSSIBLE KNOTS\") YORKE: (Singing) I'm tied up in impossible knots. I'll take anything you got. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images hide caption Beyonc\u00e9 attends the European premiere of Disney's The Lion King on July 14 in London. Beyonc\u00e9's The Lion King: The Gift album is out now. The Lion King: The Gift, Beyonc\u00e9's executive-produced album inspired by the 2019 motion picture, has been delivered. The 27-track album \u2014 14 original tracks and 13 interludes from the Disney feature film \u2014 features an impressive set of headliners like Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, Tierra Whack, Childish Gambino and Kendrick Lamar as well as global acts from Nigeria, Ghana, Jamaica and more. Lion King: The Gift pays tribute to Disney's 1994 animated classic The Lion King as well as the continent where it takes place. \"This soundtrack is a love letter to Africa, and I wanted to make sure we found the best talent from Africa,\" Bey said in a Good Morning America interview. \"I wanted to be authentic to what is beautiful about music in Africa.\" Beyonc\u00e9, who plays Nala in the new film, made it a point to feature a multi-genre artists and producers for a sound that's reflective of the diaspora of African cultures. While some songs like \"MOOD 4 EVA,\" which is produced by Bey and DJ Khaled, feature a straightforward, cinematic R&B sound, others, like Burna Boy's \"Ja Ara E\" or the heartfelt \"Brown Skin Girl\" featuring Saint JHN, Wizkid and Blue Ivy Carter, are held down with African-influenced beats and percussion by producer P2J. Nigerian artists Tekno, Yemi Alade and Mr. Eazi form an Afrobeat trifecta with \"Don't Jealous Me\" and Ghanaian musician Shatta Wale and electronic trio Major Lazer each add their own flavor to \"Already.\" Up-and-coming Cameroonian singer Salatiel has a shining introduction on the track \"Water,\" singing alongside Bey and Pharrell. The album-ender, \"Spirit,\" was the sole single shared before the album and was released earlier this week with a sprawling music video. This new release notably marks the fourth lyrical appearance of Blue Ivy Carter, first daughter of Queen Bey and Jay-Z. Previously, Blue could be heard on her mother's 2013 self-titled album, on her father's album 4:44, and on the power-couple's first official collaborative album, Everything Is Love. The album cover art also adds a sense of symbolism and power: Two gold lions, tied together as one, carry over messages of unity from the film. Beyonc\u00e9 provides a modern interpretation and vision for the story many of us already know. \"I feel like the soundtrack becomes visual in your mind,\" Beyonc\u00e9 told GMA. \"It's a soundscape. It's more than just the music because each song tells the story of the film.\" A previous version of this story misspelled Nigerian artist Yemi Alade's name as Yemi Aldade.

Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n, also known as \"El Chapo,\" was sentenced Wednesday to a life term in prison plus 30 years. After the sentencing in a Brooklyn courthouse, U.S. attorneys and other officials greeted the media, including Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Updated at 1 p.m. ET A federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., has sentenced drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 30 years for his role in leading Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. A life sentence was mandatory; U.S. prosecutors had asked that three decades be added onto Guzm\u00e1n's punishment. The sentence also includes a multibillion-dollar financial penalty for the wealthy drug dealer. \"The U.S. government says that conservatively, he's taken in about $12 billion from the drug trade, and they want it paid back,\" reporter Alexandra Starr told Morning Edition. One of the only suspenseful questions that remained was whether Guzm\u00e1n, who did not speak during his long trial, would speak Wednesday in what's expected to be his last public appearance before he likely is sent to the Supermax prison in Florence, Colo. Addressing the court in Spanish through an English interpreter, Guzm\u00e1n complained about the conditions during his detention, calling it \"the most inhumane situation\" he ever experienced, according to CNN. He said the water and the air in his cell were unhealthy, Starr said. \"In order to sleep, I have to use plugs made out of toilet paper in my ears,\" Guzm\u00e1n said, according to Molly Crane-Newman, a reporter for the New York Daily News. He added, \"It's been a lack of respect for human dignity.\" Guzm\u00e1n concluded his lengthy remarks, Crane-Newman said, by telling U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, \"The United States is no better than any other corrupt country that you don't respect.\" Guzm\u00e1n, 62, was extradited from his native Mexico to the U.S. in January 2017. The terms of his extradition included a pledge that U.S. authorities would not seek the death penalty. Guzm\u00e1n is seen arriving in New York in January 2017 after his extradition from Mexico. Reuters hide caption Guzm\u00e1n is seen arriving in New York in January 2017 after his extradition from Mexico. \"Mr. Guzm\u00e1n thought for more than 25 years that he was untouchable, that there was no problem affecting the Sinaloa cartel that he couldn't bribe, intimidate, torture or kill his way out of,\" Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said at a news conference after the sentencing. Guzm\u00e1n's punishment, Benczkowski said, \"brings a measure of justice\" to people in both the U.S. and Mexico who have been affected by his crimes. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Ariana Fajardo Orshan said the life sentence was the only option for \"somebody who has spent a lifetime poisoning the streets of our communities.\" A federal jury convicted Guzm\u00e1n in February, finding him guilty of a raft of serious charges, from drug crimes to a murder conspiracy. His conviction included 10 counts of crimes such as narcotics trafficking, using a firearm in drug crimes and money laundering. At Wednesday's sentencing, Guzm\u00e1n's attorneys reiterated their call for a new trial, asking for a hearing to go over their allegations of juror misconduct. \"This case was simply an inquisition. It was a show trial, and how it ended is exactly perfect for that description,\" defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said. He said the government's witnesses had included \"lunatics and sociopaths and psychopaths\" and that \"up to five jurors broke the law \u2014 violated the law while they were judging Mr. Guzm\u00e1n for crimes.\" After Guzm\u00e1n was convicted, his defense team said the trial was tainted, claiming that members of the jury had ignored the judge's orders not to read about the trial outside of court proceedings. Guzm\u00e1n plans to appeal, Lichtman said. \"I'm not here to tell you that Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n is a saint,\" he said, speaking to journalists outside the courthouse. \"All we asked for was fairness. And no matter what you think of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, he still deserves a fair trial.\" The U.S. sentence was announced 18 years after President George W. Bush formally declared Guzm\u00e1n a drug lord, imposing U.S. sanctions on him under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Act. The drug kingpin has repeatedly made headlines during his criminal career \u2014 first for the vast power he ruthlessly amassed and later for his seeming ability to break out of any prison in Mexico. In 2015, he escaped from a maximum security prison for the second time, after spending more than a decade eluding Mexican authorities. He lived outside the law for an additional six months, before he was captured in a high-profile operation in early 2016. Wednesday's sentencing took place amid heightened security. In addition to a police contingent, helmeted soldiers stood guard on the sidewalk outside the doors of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, holding automatic rifles and wearing camouflage. Guzm\u00e1n's lucrative and extensive criminal network extended well beyond Mexico's borders. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says his Sinaloa cartel put an exceptionally potent methamphetamine into illegal drug markets in \"virtually every corner of Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming.\" During his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Guzm\u00e1n sent methamphetamine to numerous U.S. locations, from Los Angeles to Minneapolis and from Ohio to Tucson, Ariz. The agency also said the cartel supplied cocaine and fentanyl in the U.S. \"through sophisticated and efficient transportation and distribution networks.\" To elude detection, Guzm\u00e1n paid $1 million to an information technology engineer to set up what authorities called an encrypted communications network to operate his global drug-trafficking operation. By using encrypted cellphones and encrypted apps, prosecutors said, the drug lord could communicate freely with his partners in Colombia, Ecuador, Canada and the U.S. As his cartel did billions of dollars in business, Guzm\u00e1n rose to become a pop-culture figure in Mexico, where his visage frequently appears on T-shirts and graffiti. In his poverty-stricken home town of Badiraguanto in northwest Mexico, many locals viewed him as a benefactor who sometimes helped them. But elsewhere in his country, he's viewed as a key figure in a devastating string of drug wars and violence. When the criminal mastermind slipped away from Mexican custody in 2015, he was quickly featured in dozens of narcocorrido songs \u2014 ballads about the drug business. Fueled by drug profits and a growth strategy that relied on brutality and sicario hitmen, Guzm\u00e1n's godfather-like stature rose above international borders. As The Associated Press reported in 2015: \"During his time as a fugitive, Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world. His fortune grew to be estimated at more than $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, which listed him among the 'World's Most Powerful People' and ranked him above the presidents of France and Venezuela.\" Days after Guzm\u00e1n was found guilty in a New York courtroom, U.S. authorities unsealed new criminal indictments against two of his sons in Mexico. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Lopez and Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n Lopez were charged with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States.

Force for Deterrence in Libya/AP hide caption Hashem Abedi, seen in this undated photo, is the younger brother of Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi. On Thursday, Hashem Abedi appeared in court and, through his lawyer, denied any involvement in the 2017 attack. The brother of the suicide bomber who killed nearly two dozen people after an Ariana Grande concert in 2017 appeared in a London court on Thursday to face charges that he helped carry out the attack in Manchester, England. Hashem Abedi, who was extradited from Libya this week, said through his lawyer that he was not involved in the attack. The 22-year-old wore glasses and a gray shirt and spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and British nationality, according to media reports. Abedi's older brother, Salman Abedi, detonated the device that wreaked havoc in Manchester on May 22, 2017. The bomb detonated between a train station and the concert venue as fans \u2014 including thousands of children and young people \u2014 were leaving the arena. Salman Abedi died in the blast. During Thursday's hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, the names of all 22 people killed in the bombing were read aloud. Hashem Abedi has been charged with murdering those 22 people, as well as attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. Prosecutors say he played a key role in the attack: buying chemicals for the bomb, making detonator tubes and helping purchase a car to hold the materials, according to the BBC. Abedi's lawyer, Zafar Ali, said his client denied the allegations and did not oppose extradition to the U.K. because he \"wanted to come back to clear his name,\" The Guardian reported. In the days after the bombing, Abedi was arrested in Libya. His father, Ramadan Abedi, and a third brother, Ismail Abedi, also were arrested, but neither has been charged. Libya's RADA counterterrorism force said Hashem Abedi was an engineering student connected to ISIS. NPR's Bill Chappell reported at the time that authorities had been monitoring him for about a month and that Abedi had been preparing an attack of his own in Tripoli. Abedi's lawyer said his client had been tortured and pressured to make a confession after he was arrested in Libya, according to The Associated Press. On Wednesday, Abedi was flown to the U.K., escorted by British police officers. He was swiftly arrested by U.K. authorities after landing. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins announced the arrest, saying that since the Manchester attack, \"our thoughts have been with the families of those who lost loved ones and the hundreds who are struggling with serious physical injuries and deep psychological effects.\" The court was told that hundreds of people reported having been psychologically harmed by the bombing. Grande told British Vogue that she had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Abedi family fled Libya during Moammar Gadhafi's regime. Since Gadhafi's fall, Libya has seen rampant political instability and fighting factions, which appears to have contributed to the lengthy extradition process. Abedi was ordered detained, and the case was adjourned until a bail hearing on Monday. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Nick Wass/AP hide caption Los Angeles Sparks guard Riquna Williams (right) dribbles in a playoff game against the Washington Mystics last year. Updated at 4:15 p.m. ET The WNBA has suspended Los Angeles Sparks guard Riquna Williams for 10 games without pay over a domestic violence incident in which she allegedly attacked a former girlfriend. Williams was arrested in April and charged with two felony counts after authorities in Florida say she punched the woman in the head and then threatened another person with a gun. The WNBA said it launched its own investigation into the matter, including interviews with several witnesses and a consultation with domestic violence experts, before rendering the 10-game suspension, which is about a third of a regular season. \"Among other factors, the WNBA took into account the nature and seriousness of the conduct at issue, including the involvement of a firearm,\" the league said in a statement. Despite the charges, the Sparks re-signed Williams and she has been playing this season. Her suspension starts Thursday, when the Sparks take on the Dallas Wings. The Women's National Basketball Players Association, the union representing WNBA players, plans to file a grievance. \"We are disappointed with the league's actions. There is an ongoing criminal proceeding and in fairness to the player, the league could have and should have awaited its completion before taking any action,\" Terri Jackson, the union's executive director, told NPR in a statement. \"Riquana has not had a fair opportunity to fully defend herself.\" According to an arrest report, Williams showed up at a residence in Pahokee, Fla. where Alkeria Davis was on Dec. 6, 2018. Police say Williams tried to get in by hitting the outside door with a skateboard. Davis came to the door and there was a struggle as Williams tried to force her way into the residence, according to the report. It says Williams managed to get inside and then punched Davis multiple times in the head and pulled her hair. Two men spent 10 minutes attempting to break up the fight before they were able to separate the two women and get Williams outside. At that point, according to the report, Williams walked to a blue Camaro, grabbed a gun and pointed it at one of the men, saying \"You'll get all 18\" before speeding away. Davis told deputies with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office that she and Williams had been dating on and off for five years, but had broken up a month before the incident. She told authorities she believes Williams was jealous that Davis was not with her, according to court records. The altercation, Davis told police, left her with a lump on the side of her head. Williams was arrested on April 29 and charged with burglary, with assault or battery, and with aggravated assault with a deadly firearm, court records show. She pleaded not guilty and was released on a $20,000 bond. The judge ordered that she not possess any weapons and have no contact with the victims. Her next court date is Aug. 16. Lawyer Daniel Riccardo Paige Sr., who is representing Williams, did not return a request for comment. The WNBA said in addition to the 10-game suspension, the league will require Williams receive to counseling. The Sparks issued a statement to NPR saying the team has fully cooperated with the league's investigation. \"As an organization, we abhor violence of any kind and specifically take domestic violence allegations very seriously,\" according to the Sparks' statement. \"We will provide whatever resources we are allowed to help Riquna learn and grow from this unfortunate situation.\" Williams' suspension comes as the WNBA investigates another recent domestic violence case, involving Seattle Storm player Natasha Howard, who has been accused by her wife of domestic abuse.

        "texts": "AILSA CHANG, HOST: More than 3,000 federal prisoners are headed home today. They've won early release because of criminal justice law called the First Step Act. NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: The deputy attorney general says meeting deadlines set by the First Step Act seven months ago took a monumental effort, and Jeffrey Rosen says it's not over yet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFFREY ROSEN: Using top-of-the-line research, people and technology, the department intends to implement this law forcefully, fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law. JOHNSON: Most of the 3,100 inmates getting out this week committed drug crimes, before racking up good behavior credits that helped pave the way for their release. Toni Bacon works on the issue at the Justice Department. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TONI BACON: In terms of the range of people who have been released in - the largest number are drug offenders, the second group are weapons and explosives, and the third are sex offenders. But there's a very wide range of people who are being released. JOHNSON: They've been living in halfway houses, getting ready to go home. But about 900 of them will now be subject to immigration detention. Hugh Hurwitz is acting director at the Bureau of Prisons. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HUGH HURWITZ: I can't tell you where they'll go because that's up to states or Homeland Security. JOHNSON: Another 250 inmates who are very old or very sick have been moved into home confinement or compassionate release. Prison officials often stonewalled those requests before the First Step Act made the process a bit easier. Advocates for overhauling the justice system welcome those changes, but they say Congress should weigh in to make sure the Justice Department is living up to its promises. Inimai Chettiar is policy director at the Justice Action Network. INIMAI CHETTIAR: There's a lot of skepticism around whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law, and so we definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law. JOHNSON: After protests from advocates, DOJ says it has moved $75 million from other prison programs to help fund the First Step Act this year. Chettiar says that leaves a big question for 2020 and beyond. CHETTIAR: The only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.

But a close read reveals some initiatives in Biden's plan that are so expansive they might have trouble passing even a Congress held by Democrats. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Opponents running to Joe Biden's left say his health plan for America merely \"tinkers around the edges\" of the Affordable Care Act. But a close read reveals some initiatives in Biden's plan that are so expansive they might have trouble passing even a Congress held by Democrats. The headlines about presidential candidate Joe Biden's new health care plan called it \"a nod to the past\" and \"Affordable Care Act 2.0.\" That mostly refers to the fact that the former vice president has specifically repudiated many of his Democratic rivals' calls for a \"Medicare for All\" system, and instead sought to build his plan on the ACA's framework. Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's opponents in the primary race and the key proponent of the Medicare for All option, has criticized Biden's proposal, complaining that it is just \"tinkering around the edges\" of a broken health care system. Still, the proposal put forward by Biden earlier this week is much more ambitious than Obamacare \u2013 and despite its incremental label, would make some very controversial changes. \"I would call it radically incremental,\" says Chris Jennings, a political health strategist who worked for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and who has consulted with several of the current Democratic candidates. Republicans who object to other candidates' Medicare for All plans find Biden's alternative just as displeasing. \"No matter how much Biden wants to draw distinctions between his proposals and single-payer, his plan looks suspiciously like \"SandersCare Lite,\" writes former congressional aide and conservative commentator Chris Jacobs in a column for The Federalist. Biden's plan is built on the idea of expanding the ACA to reduce costs for patients and consumers \u2014 similar to what Hillary Clinton campaigned on in 2016. It would do things Democrats have called for repeatedly since the ACA was passed. Among Biden's proposals is a provision that would \"uncap\" federal help to pay for health insurance premiums \u2014 assistance now available only to those with incomes that are 400% of the poverty level, or about $50,000 for an individual. Under Biden's plan, no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums. But it includes several proposals that Congress has failed repeatedly to enact, including some that were part of the original debate over the ACA. Plus, Biden's plan has some initiatives that are so expansive, it is hard to imagine them passing Congress \u2014 even if Democrats sweep the presidency and both houses of Congress in 2020. Here are some of the more controversial pieces of the Biden health plan: Public option Although many of the Democratic presidential candidates have expressed varying degrees of support for a Medicare for All plan, nearly all have also endorsed creating a government-sponsored health plan, known colloquially as a \"public option,\" that would be available to people who buy their own health insurance. That eligible group would include anyone who doesn't get insurance through their job or who doesn't qualify for other government programs, like Medicare or Medicaid. A public option was included in the version of the ACA that passed the House in 2009. But its proponents could not muster the 60 votes needed to pass that option in the Senate over GOP objections \u2014 even though the Democrats had 60 votes at the time. Biden's public option, however, would be available to many more people than the 20 million or so who are now in the individual insurance market. According to the document put out by the campaign, this public option also would be available to those who don't like or can't afford their employer insurance, and to small businesses. Most controversial, though, is that the 2.5 million people currently ineligible for either Medicaid or private insurance subsidies because their states have chosen not to expand Medicaid would be automatically enrolled in Biden's public option, at no cost to them or the states where they live. Also included automatically in the public option would be another 2 million people with low incomes who currently are eligible for ACA coverage subsidies \u2013 and who would also be eligible for expanded Medicaid. That part of Biden's proposal has prompted charges that the 14 states that have so far chosen not to expand Medicaid would save money, compared with those that have already expanded the program, because expansion states have to pay 10% of the cost of that new population. Jennings, the Democratic health strategist, argues that extra charge to states that previously expanded Medicaid would be unavoidable under Biden's plan, because people with low incomes in states that haven't expanded Medicaid need coverage most. \"If you're not going to have everyone get a plan right away, you need to make sure those who are most vulnerable do,\" Jennings says. Abortion The Biden plan calls for eliminating the \"Hyde Amendment,\" an annual rider to the spending bill for the Department of Health and Human Services that forbids the use of federal funds to pay for most abortions. Biden recently ran into some difficulty when his position on the Hyde ammendment was unclear. Beyond that, Biden's plan also directly calls for the federal government to fund some abortions. \"[T]he public option will cover contraception and a woman's constitutional right to choose,\" his plan says. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act very nearly failed to become law after an intraparty fight between Democrats who supported and opposed federal funding for abortions. Abortion opponents wanted firm guarantees in permanent law that no federal funds would ever be used for abortion; abortion-rights supporters called that a deal breaker. Eventually a shaky compromise was reached. And while it is true that there are now far fewer Democrats in Congress who oppose abortion than there were in 2010, the idea of even a Democratic-controlled Congress voting for federal abortion funding seems far-fetched. The current Democratic-led House has declined even to include a repeal of the Hyde Amendment in this year's HHS spending bill, because it could not get through the GOP-controlled Senate or get signed by President Trump. Undocumented immigrants When Obama said in a speech to Congress in September 2009 that people not in the U.S. legally would be ineligible for federal help with their purchase of health insurance under the ACA, it prompted the infamous \"You lie!\" shout from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C.. Today, all the Democratic candidates say they would provide coverage to undocumented residents. There is no mention of them specifically in the plan posted on Biden's website, although a Biden campaign official told Politico this week that people in the U.S. who are undocumented would be able to purchase plans on the health insurance exchanges, but would not qualify for subsidies. Still, in his speech unveiling the plan at an AARP-sponsored candidate forum in Iowa, Biden did not address this issue of immigrants' health care. He said only that his plan would expand funding for community health centers, which serve patients regardless of their ability to pay or their immigration status, and that people in the U.S. without legal authority would be able to obtain coverage in emergencies.

Gregory Bull/AP hide caption People wait in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday to apply for asylum in the United States. A memo notified officers that immigrants at the southern border are ineligible for asylum, with a few exceptions. The Trump administration has implemented its strongest effort yet to curb asylum claims, but an internal memo shows that U.S. asylum officers weren't briefed until just hours before the sweeping immigration rule went into effect Tuesday. The new policy bars most immigrants from a long-held practice of applying for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. People seeking asylum must instead apply for protections in countries they passed through on their way to the United States. In the Monday night memo obtained by NPR, the head of asylum at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, John Lafferty, said asylum officers were \"once again being asked to adapt, and to do so with very little time to train and prepare.\" Lafferty went on to commend his staff at USCIS while noting the suddenness of the new rule. \"If I didn't know that we have some of the most dedicated, most adaptable and most talented public servants presently serving in the federal government, I would be concerned about being able to implement these changes on such short notice,\" he said. The agency's asylum officers conduct so-called credible fear interviews \u2014 the first step an immigrant goes through to begin the process of filing an asylum claim. The Trump administration insists that migrants are taking advantage of an already overwhelmed system. USCIS acting Director Ken Cuccinelli reiterated the president's declaration in February that a national emergency has unfolded at the U.S. southern border, a move that could allocate billions of dollars to fund his controversial wall. \"Absent congressional action, the Trump Administration is using all authorities available under the law to address the crisis at the border,\" Cuccinelli said in a statement to NPR. \"This rule aims to mitigate the crisis at the border by better identifying those in need of protection.\" The administration's new rule was announced Monday and published in the Federal Register on Tuesday morning. Later Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups filed a lawsuit to challenge the rule. Lee Gelernt, deputy director at the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, told NPR that the administration's regulation is \"patently unlawful. It's just unilaterally rewriting the asylum laws Congress has enacted.\" Immigration advocates say the new policy flies in the face of a core U.S. tenet \u2014 to protect people from being sent back to places where they face persecution. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, people who arrive on U.S. soil are eligible to apply for asylum if they say they fear persecution in their home countries. Immigration reporter Molly O'Toole of the Los Angeles Times told NPR that the president has vowed to target illegal immigration, \"but many of the policies have actually targeted legal immigration, and asylum is that category.\" The new rule allows for few exceptions: if migrants first applied for asylum in a country they passed through on their route to the United States, if they prove they were victims of severe human trafficking, or if they traveled through countries that were not signatories to international conventions on refugees or torture \u2014 such as North Korea or Myanmar. Many migrants likely are unaware that the Trump administration's new rule would affect their cases. On Tuesday, a throng of immigrants stood around in a Tijuana parking lot, near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, as they waited for immigration hearings in the U.S., under the Trump administration's \"remain in Mexico\" policy. Few of those migrants knew about the new asylum rule, KPBS' Max Rivlin-Nadler reports for NPR. An unofficial waitlist there was filled with 9,000 names, including those of immigrants from Cameroon and Eritrea. A man who did not give his name out of fear for his safety told Rivlin-Nadler that he fled Cameroon after his family was attacked by government troops. The man, who said he traveled through eight countries to reach the United States, said it would have been difficult for him to apply for asylum in those places because he doesn't speak Spanish. \"They don't even attempt to speak English,\" he said. \"They don't even attempt to listen to you. So if you're speaking English it's like nobody cares.\" In Guatemala, meanwhile, other immigrants were waiting this week to be processed by that country's asylum system. Jose Jonathan Escobar told NPR that his family fled after a gang in his native El Salvador threatened his family. \"We pleaded with them not to kill us, but in the end they told us you have three days to get out of your house.\" He said gang members killed three of his brothers and the mother of his two daughters. The family traveled to Mexico, but refugee offices were crowded with migrants and they had to sleep on the streets. \"I just want my family to be OK,\" Escobar said.

I arrived there in chains,\" Kidd says. Over 76 days, he says, he was strip searched, subject to filthy conditions, denied medications, and briefly placed in solitary confinement. Osny Kidd says he was strip searched, denied medications, and briefly placed in solitary confinement at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. Family photo courtesy of Chance Kidd hide caption Osny Kidd says he was strip searched, denied medications, and briefly placed in solitary confinement at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. The treatment and conditions Kidd describes raise questions of whether the detention facility violated ICE's detention standards, based on a review of an ICE manual that details those standards. The contractor ICE hired to inspect its facilities found no problems at Adelanto in recent years. That contractor, a private firm called the Nakamoto Group, has become a lightning rod for criticism. The Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General has repeatedly criticized the company for cutting corners on its investigations, conducting improper interviews, and producing inaccurate reports. In one instance, the government watchdog said ICE failed to take seriously the problem of braided bed sheets hanging in detainee cells. It said similar braided sheets had been used as a noose in one suicide and in several other attempts. For many critics, Nakamoto's failures cited in the government reports help explain why unsanitary, harsh conditions at the detention centers persist. Public scrutiny of detention facilities continues to increase. Meanwhile, the population of those detained at ICE's facilities last month reached an all-time high of 54,000. At the same time, there are persistent questions from the inspector general about whether ICE is properly overseeing the contractors that run a majority of the agency's facilities. ICE relies heavily on private industry in nearly every aspect of its operation. Outside contractors GEO Group and CoreCivic operate most of ICE's adult detention centers. For the last eight years, Nakamoto has been charged with conducting annual inspections of ICE detention centers, including those run by GEO and CoreCivic. \"It's really not an exaggeration to say that there is basically no meaningful accountability or oversight for the companies who are involved,\" says Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, an immigrant rights group. The DHS inspector general not only criticized Nakamoto's work, it also faulted ICE for not properly overseeing Nakamoto. \"ICE does not adequately hold detention facility contractors accountable for not meeting performance standards,\" the inspector general wrote in its latest report in January. A razor wire fence surrounds the Adelanto immigration detention center, in Adelanto, Calif., April 13, 2017. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters hide caption A razor wire fence surrounds the Adelanto immigration detention center, in Adelanto, Calif., April 13, 2017. The result, critics say, is that detainees are subject to everything from solitary confinement to negligent medical care. Kidd, the 24-year-old former Adelanto detainee, says he filed grievances about his experiences. (Kidd married in December; prior to that his last name was Sorto.) Kidd's Honduran mother brought him to the U.S. when he was 9. He was supposed to be protected from deportation under DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, but ICE agents arrested him outside his apartment because of a DUI charge that was later expunged from his record. Kidd says the treatment at Adelanto was inhumane. One day, during an evacuation, he says a guard screamed obscenities, calling him and his fellow detainees names. \"I mean, that's when I kind of lost it,\" Kidd says. \"I just said, 'You cannot call me that, you cannot treat us like animals, because we're not.' \" For this, Kidd says he was briefly taken to a solitary confinement room called \"Bravo.\" \"In Bravo, there was nobody watching in there,\" Kidd says. \"You'd see people come out of there with bruises. I saw them come out of there with bruises.\" Kidd filed grievances under ICE procedures with GEO Group, which ran the facility. He says GEO promised to interview his fellow detainees about the mistreatment, but never did. He says GEO dismissed his complaint. ICE did not respond to requests seeking comment about Kidd's claims. GEO referred questions regarding the case to ICE. Kidd's attorney, Sabrina Damast, says such treatment and conditions should have alarmed inspectors. But Nakamoto inspectors reported no problems at Adelanto in 2017 and 2018. For the last eight years, the company has held the contract to inspect conditions at more than 100 ICE facilities, including Adelanto. (Nakamoto inspections from previous years have not been made public.) The last time ICE's own Office of Detention Oversight reviewed Adelanto was in 2014. That year, ICE's internal review found the facility already fell short in six areas, including how it addressed sexual assault, its handling of detainee grievances and its food service. (Earlier this year, NPR sued the City of Adelanto seeking access to documents regarding conditions at that facility.) ICE declined an interview. But its spokeswoman Danielle Bennett says the agency has improved since the inspector general's reports. In an emailed statement, Bennett said senior ICE officials now accompany Nakamoto investigators during their reviews. ICE, she notes, has multiple layers of oversight, including local staff stationed in each facility. Bennett says the agency is also holding contractors accountable. Between December 2018 and March 2019, she says, financial penalties against the contractors totaled $500,000. But one former senior ICE official told NPR the changes Bennett points out are minor. The bigger problem is ICE has no incentive to acknowledge problems. One of ICE's performance goals is for all of its detention centers to pass inspection \u2014 and the former official, who requested anonymity to protect future employment prospects, says Nakamoto is well aware of the pressures to meet that target. Nakamoto is a private firm based outside Washington, D.C. Its Japanese-American owner, Jennifer Nakamoto, frequently credits her family's experience in World War II internment camps with shaping her company's mission. The company's inspections contract with ICE started in 2011. According to USAspending, the federal government's contracting database, the potential value of Nakamoto's contract was $116 million last fiscal year. Claudia Valenzuela is an attorney with the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group. She's filed lawsuits seeking information about ICE and its contractors. \"I think there should be more public scrutiny of Nakamoto,\" Valenzuela says. \"How did it obtain the contract? How does this company continue to hold that contract?\" But Nakamoto says it stands by its performance. In an email, Nakamoto Vice President Mark Saunders said, \"we have made it abundantly clear that we are in no way political, and we have no agenda other than to do our work.\" He declined an interview, saying the company has already addressed negative allegations. Last fall, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats asked Nakamoto to respond to problems raised in the inspector general's reports. In her response, Jennifer Nakamoto quoted from her own company's report, calling the watchdog investigators inexperienced and their findings an \"embarrassment\" to their office. She disputes many of the facts in the reports. She wrote about her mother's birth in an internment camp, saying she and her family have battled prejudice all their lives. \"Without question,\" she wrote, \"the detained immigrant population as a whole has a better life because of what Nakamoto does.\" That response has not mollified critics. Brian Cohen, Warren's oversight and investigations director, says neither Nakamoto nor ICE has shown interest in making changes. He says ICE has also not responded to follow up inquiries sent in April and June. \"What we concluded from all this mess is that still, nobody's taken responsibility,\" Cohen says. Nakamoto's contract with ICE is set to expire in September. ICE declined to comment about whether it would renew it.

Susan Walsh/AP hide caption From left, Hugh Hurwitz, acting director of the Bureau of Prisons; Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen; and David Muhlhausen, director of the National Institute of Justice, appear at a press conference at the Department of Justice on Friday. Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call \"a truly monumental effort\" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year. Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington. About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said. The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December. Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access. \"The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,\" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law. Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program. In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would \"vigilantly\" review the new risk assessment system. \"It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,\" the senators said. Questions about implementation The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress. \"The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' \" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year. \"We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,\" they said. Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable. Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general. \"There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,\" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network. \"We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.\" Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference. \"Every day of freedom is important,\" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \"We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Watchdog: Key ICE Contractor Overlooked Problems In Detention Centers : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: There's growing pressure to overhaul how the U.S. detains undocumented migrants. The number of people held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers last month topped 54,000, a record high. Private companies, contractors run many of these facilities. They've been criticized for poor health and safety conditions, and there are persistent questions about one contractor in particular. It gets paid tens of millions of dollars a year to ensure that other contractors are doing their job. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has the story. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: ICE relies heavily on a small company called the Nakamoto Group. Nakamoto's job is to inspect the work of other contractors at more than a hundred ICE detention facilities. But Nakamoto has become a lightning rod for criticism. A government watchdog has repeatedly criticized it for failing to catch problems. For many, Nakamoto's failures help explain why unsanitary harsh conditions at detention centers persist. Heidi Altman is policy director at the advocacy group National Immigrant Justice Center. HEIDI ALTMAN: It's really not an exaggeration to say that there is basically no meaningful accountability or oversight for the companies who are involved. NOGUCHI: The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general repeatedly cited Nakamoto for cutting corners, not reporting violations, conducting improper interviews and writing inaccurate reports. It also said ICE allowed it to happen. The watchdog's latest report in January reads, quote, \"ICE does not adequately hold detention facility contractors accountable for not meeting performance standards.\" The result, critics say, is detainees are subject to everything from solitary confinement to negligent medical care at the detention facilities. Osny Kidd says he experienced both. Last fall, Kidd spent 76 days at the detention center in Adelanto, Calif. OSNY KIDD: I was in handcuffs from feet to waist to arms. I arrived there in chains. NOGUCHI: Kid's Honduran mother brought him to the U.S. at age 9. Now 24, Kid was supposed to be protected from deportation under DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But ICE agents arrested him outside his apartment because of a DUI charge that was later expunged. At Adelanto, Kidd says he was held in an overcrowded room and stripped naked. He was forced to clean filthy showers. All these raise questions about whether ICE's own detention standards were violated. One day, Kidd says a guard screamed obscenities, calling him and his fellow detainees names. KIDD: I mean, that's when I kind of lost it. I just said, you cannot call me that. You cannot treat us like animals because we're not. NOGUCHI: For this, Kidd says he was briefly taken to a solitary confinement room called Bravo. KIDD: In Bravo, there was nobody watching in there. You'd see people come out of there with bruises. I saw them come out of there with bruises. NOGUCHI: Kidd filed grievances. He said he was told his claims were investigated and his complaint dismissed. ICE didn't respond to requests seeking comment on his claims. Kidd's attorney says the treatment and conditions should have alarmed inspectors, but Nakamoto inspectors reported no problems at Adelanto in 2017 and 2018. Every year since 2011, Nakamoto has inspected all ICE facilities which house adult immigrants. The last time ICE itself inspected Adelanto was in 2014. That internal review found the facility already falling short in six areas, including addressing sexual assault and detainee grievances. ICE declined an interview, but spokeswoman Danielle Bennett says the agency has improved since the IG reports. In an email, she said senior ICE officials now accompany Nakamoto investigators during their inspections. Bennett says ICE is also holding contractors accountable. Between last December and March of this year, she says financial penalties against those contractors have totaled half a million dollars. But one former senior ICE official told me those changes are minor. The bigger problem is ICE has no incentive to acknowledge problems. One of ICE's performance goals is for all of their detention centers to pass inspection. The former official who requested anonymity to protect future employment prospects says Nakamoto is well aware of the pressures to meet that target.

Its Japanese American owner Jennifer Nakamoto, frequently credits her family's experiences in World War II internment camps with shaping her company's mission. According to contracting database USAspending, the potential value of Nakamoto's contract last fiscal year was $116 million. Claudia Valenzuela is an attorney with the advocacy group American Immigration Council. She has filed lawsuits seeking information about ICE's contractors. CLAUDIA VALENZUELA: I think there should be more public scrutiny of Nakamoto. How did it obtain the contract? How does this company continue to hold that contract? It really actually is mind boggling to me. NOGUCHI: But Nakamoto says it stands by its performance. In an email, Mark Saunders, Nakamoto's vice president, said, quote, \"we have made it abundantly clear that we are in no way political, and we have no agenda other than to do our work.\" He declined an interview, saying the company already addressed negative allegations. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats last fall asked Nakamoto to respond to problems raised in the IG's reports. Jennifer Nakamoto called the watchdog investigators inexperienced and their findings an embarrassment to their office. She disputed many of the facts in the reports. She highlighted how her mother was born in an internment camp, saying she and her family battled prejudice. She wrote, quote, \"without question, the detained immigrant population as a whole has a better life because of what Nakamoto does.\" That response hasn't mollified critics who want Nakamoto and ICE to answer for the problems. Brian Cohen is Senator Warren's oversight and investigations director. BRIAN COHEN: And what we concluded from all this mess is that still nobody's taking responsibility. NOGUCHI: Nakamoto's contract ends in September. ICE declined to say whether it will renew that contract. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Earlier this month, Bosnian Muslims visited the graves of their relatives at the memorial cemetery of the Srebrenica 1995 massacre in Potocari, near Srebrenica. Elvis Barukcic/AFP/Getty Images hide caption \"The Dutch State bears very limited liability in the 'Mothers of Srebenica' case,\" the Supreme Court said Friday. Earlier this month, Bosnian Muslims visited the graves of their relatives at the memorial cemetery of the Srebrenica 1995 massacre in Potocari, near Srebrenica. The Netherlands' Supreme Court has affirmed that the country's troops are partly to blame for the deaths of 350 Muslim men and boys after the fall of the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica. But in a break with an earlier ruling, the court lowered the Dutch liability for the massacre to 10%, from 30%. \"The Dutch State bears very limited liability in the 'Mothers of Srebenica' case,\" the Supreme Court said as it announced the ruling. The Mothers of Srebenica is an umbrella group formed by families and loved ones who say Dutch U.N. peacekeeping troops didn't do everything they could to prevent the Muslim men and boys from being slaughtered by Bosnian Serbs led by Ratko Mladic, the \"butcher of Bosnia\" who was convicted of genocide and war crimes in 2017. A U.N. war crimes tribunal found Mladic guilty of \"masterminding the killing of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Europe's worst massacre since World War II,\" NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports. The case centers on the deadly days after Srebrenica fell on July 11, 1995, when Bosnian Serb troops entered the city and some 25,000 refugees sought refuge with a Dutch battalion called Dutchbat III, in what was deemed a \"minimum safe area\" away from hostilities. At the time, both the U.N. and the Netherlands agreed that the refugees and peacekeepers must be evacuated. But the families say the Dutch force failed in two key respects: by cooperating with Mladic's force to allow refugees to be taken to buses through a narrow sluice that made it easy to separate males from the crowd and, toward the end of the evacuation, by not offering 350 men and boys a chance to stay in the Dutch compound. In an earlier ruling, the Hague Court of Appeal had largely agreed with the families on those points, saying that the \"group of refugees was denied a 30 percent chance of avoiding abuse and execution,\" as the Supreme Court said. But in its own ruling Friday, the Supreme Court, or Hoge Raad, said it \"estimates that the male refugees had a 10 percent chance of escaping from the Bosnian Serbs, had they been offered the choice to remain in the compound.\" The high court split with the Court of Appeal on how the main evacuation was handled, saying, \"The fate of the refugees would not have been changed had Dutchbat stopped cooperating, because the Bosnian Serbs would have continued the evacuation in some other way.\" Suggesting that the peacekeepers were right to cooperate with the hostile force outside its compound, the court said, \"Dutchbat's choice to continue providing guidance in order to prevent women and children from being trampled was not wrongful.\" As for the fate of the 350 male Muslims \u2014 who had remained in the Dutch camp without being seen by the Bosnian Serb force \u2014 the Supreme Court said the chance they would have escaped with their lives had they been given the choice to stay \"was slim, but not negligible.\" Mladic's fighters likely would have discovered the men and boys during an inspection of the compound their fate would have been sealed, the court said. It added, \"The chance of Dutchbat receiving effective support from the international community was slim.\" As a result, the court said, the state's liability is \"limited to 10 percent of the damages suffered by the surviving relatives of these 350 male refugees,\" and those survivors may now seek compensation from the Netherlands. \"The claimants are likely to get only a few thousand euros in compensation\" NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports. \"But the ruling could set an international legal precedent for states' liability when their troops take part in peacekeeping missions.\" The high court ruled that the Dutch peacekeepers' actions before the evacuation order were free from liability because they were operating under U.N. authority. But after the decision was made to evacuate, the court said, the Netherlands \"exercised effective control over Dutchbat's conduct and Dutchbat's actions were attributable to the State.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Steven Senne/AP hide caption Massachusetts prosecutors dropped criminal charges against actor Kevin Spacey on Wednesday. The Oscar winner was accused of groping an 18-year-old man at a restaurant in 2016. Updated at 8:20 p.m. ET Prosecutors have dropped a criminal case against Kevin Spacey in which the actor was accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man in Nantucket, Mass., in 2016. Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said in court documents filed Wednesday that he was abandoning the case \"due to the unavailability of the complaining witness.\" The case began to fall apart after the alleged victim decided to stop testifying, invoking the Fifth Amendment on the witness stand last week. The allegations stem from an encounter between the man and the actor in 2016. According to the accuser, who was 18 at the time, Spacey got him drunk and then unzipped his pants and groped him for several minutes at the crowded restaurant. The Academy Award-winning star had pleaded not guilty to the felony charge of indecent assault and battery. The 59-year-old had faced up to five years in prison if convicted. The fatal blow to the case was struck at an evidentiary hearing at which the defense was grilling the accuser about the cellphone he was using on the night he said he was assaulted. Alan Jackson, Spacey's lawyer, argued the man had deleted text chains with the actor that would have shown he was innocent. At one point during the hearing, Jackson asked the accuser whether he was aware that manipulating evidence is a crime. After a break in the proceedings, the man's lawyers said he was pleading the Fifth in order to not incriminate himself. The man has also maintained that he lost the phone. Mitchell Garabedian, who was not part of the criminal case but served as the accuser's civil attorney, said in an emailed statement, \"My client and his family have shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances.\" The civil suit led by Garabedian was dropped on July 5. He did not provide an explanation. This was the first criminal case brought against Spacey, but other allegations of sexual misconduct have dogged the actor since 2017. Actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of climbing on top of him in bed \"making sexual advances.\" Rapp was 14 at the time while Spacey was 26. Spacey has since apologized for the incident, although he says he doesn't remember it. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

It's the first public trial to emerge from roughly 2,000 U.S. lawsuits aimed at holding drugmakers accountable for the nation's opioid epidemic. Chris Landsberger/The Oklahoman hide caption Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter begins closing statements during the opioid trial at the Cleveland County Courthouse in Norman, Okla., on Monday, July 15. It's the first public trial to emerge from roughly 2,000 U.S. lawsuits aimed at holding drugmakers accountable for the nation's opioid epidemic. A global megacorporation best known for Band-Aids and baby powder may have to pay billions for its alleged role in the opioid crisis. Johnson & Johnson was the sole defendant in a closely-watched trial that wrapped up in Oklahoma state court this week, with a decision expected later this summer. The ruling in the civil case could be the first that would hold a pharmaceutical company responsible for one of the worst drug epidemics in American history. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter's lawsuit alleges Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals helped ignite the opioid crisis with overly aggressive marketing, leading to thousands of overdose deaths over the past decade in Oklahoma alone. The trial took place over seven weeks in the college town of Norman. Instead of a jury, a state judge heard the case. During closing arguments Monday, Hunter called the company the \"kingpin\" of the opioid crisis. \"What is truly unprecedented here is the conduct of these defendants on embarking on a cunning, cynical and deceitful scheme to create the need for opioids,\" Hunter said. The state urged Judge Thad Balkman, who presided over the civil trial for seven weeks, to find Johnson & Johnson liable for creating a \"public nuisance\" and force the company to pay more than $17 billion over 30 years to abate the public health crisis in the state. Driving the opioid crisis home has been a cornerstone of the Oklahoma's lawsuit. In closing arguments Monday, one of the state's attorneys, Brad Beckworth, cited staggering prescribing statistics in Cleveland County, where the trial took place. \"What we do have in Cleveland County is 135 prescription opioids for every adult,\" Beckworth explained. \"Those didn't get here from drug cartels. They got here from one cartel: the pharmaceutical industry cartel. And the kingpin of it all is Johnson & Johnson.\" Johnson & Johnson's attorney Larry Ottaway, rejected that idea in his closing argument, saying the company's products, which had included the fentanyl patch Duragesic and the opioid-based pill Nucynta, were minimally used in Oklahoma. He scoffed at the idea that physicians in the state were convinced to unnecessarily prescribe opioids due to the company's marketing tactics. \"The FDA label clearly set forth the risk of addiction, abuse and misuse that could lead to overdose and death. Don't tell me that doctors weren't aware of the risks,\" Ottaway said. Defense attorney Larry Ottaway speaks for Johnson & Johnson during closing arguments. Oklahoma is asking a state judge for $17.5 billion to help pay for addiction treatment and prevention. Sue Ogrocki/AP Photo hide caption Defense attorney Larry Ottaway speaks for Johnson & Johnson during closing arguments. Oklahoma is asking a state judge for $17.5 billion to help pay for addiction treatment and prevention. Ottaway played video testimony from earlier in the trial, showing Oklahoma doctors who said they were not misled about the drugs' risks before prescribing them. \"Only a company that believes its innocence would come in and defend itself against a state, but we take the challenge on because we believe we are right,\" Ottaway said in his closing argument. Johnson & Johnson fought on after settlements Initially, Hunter's lawsuit included Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In March, Purdue Pharma settled with the state for $270 million. Soon after, Hunter dropped all but one of the civil claims, including fraud, against the two remaining defendants. Just two days before the trial began, another defendant, Teva Pharmaceuticals of Jerusalem, announced an $85 million settlement with the state. The money will be used for litigation costs and an undisclosed amount will be allocated \"to abate the opioid crisis in Oklahoma,\" according to a press release from Hunter's office. Both companies deny any wrongdoing. The legal liability of 'public nuisance' Most states and more than 1,600 local and tribal governments are suing drugmakers who manufactured various kinds of opioid medications, and drug distributors. They are trying to recoup billions of dollars spent addressing the human costs of opioid addiction. \"Everyone is looking to see what's going to happen with this case, whether it is going to be tobacco all over again, or whether it's going to go the way the litigation against the gun-makers went,\" says University of Georgia law professor Elizabeth Burch. But the legal strategy is complicated. Unlike the tobacco industry, from which states won a landmark settlement, the makers of prescription opioids manufacture a product that serves a legitimate medical purpose, and is prescribed by highly trained physicians \u2014 a point that Johnson & Johnson's lawyers made numerous times during the trial. Oklahoma's legal team based its entire case on a claim of public nuisance, which refers to actions that harm members of the public, including injury to public health. Burch says each state has its own public nuisance statute, and Oklahoma's is very broad. \"Johnson & Johnson, in some ways, is right to raise the question: If we're going to apply public nuisance to us, under these circumstances, what are the limits?\" Burch says. \"If the judge or an appellate court sides with the state, they are going to have to write a very specific ruling on why public nuisance applies to this case.\" Burch says the challenge for Oklahoma has been to tie one opioid manufacturer to all of the harms caused by the ongoing public health crisis, which includes people struggling with addiction to prescription drugs, but also those harmed by illegal street opioids, such as heroin. University of Kentucky law professor Richard Ausness agrees that it's difficult to pin all the problems on just one company. \"Companies do unethical or immoral things all the time, but that doesn't make it illegal,\" Ausness says. Judge Thad Balkman listens to closing statements at the Cleveland County Courthouse. The case was a bench trial, with both sides seeking to persuade a single judge instead of a jury. Balkman is expected to issue his decision in August. Chris Landsberger/The Oklahoman hide caption Judge Thad Balkman listens to closing statements at the Cleveland County Courthouse. The case was a bench trial, with both sides seeking to persuade a single judge instead of a jury. Balkman is expected to issue his decision in August. If the judge rules against Johnson & Johnson, Ausness says, it could compel other drug companies facing litigation to settle out of court. Conversely, a victory for the drug giant could embolden the industry in the other cases. Earlier in the trial, the state's expert witness, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, testified that Johnson & Johnson did more than push its own pills \u2014 until 2016, it also profited by manufacturing raw ingredients for opioids and then selling them to other companies, including Purdue, which makes Oxycontin. \"Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers have been stealing the spotlight, but Johnson & Johnson in some ways, has been even worse,\" Kolodny testified. Kolodny says that's why the company downplayed to doctors the risks of opioids as a general class of drugs, knowing that almost any opioid prescription would benefit its bottom line. The state's case also focused on the role of drug sales representatives. Drue Diesselhorst was one of Johnson & Johnson's busiest drug reps in Oklahoma. Records discussed during the trial showed she continued to call on Oklahoma doctors who had been disciplined by the state for overprescribing opioids. She even continued to meet with doctors who had patients who died from overdoses. But Diesselhorst testified she didn't know about the deaths, and no one ever instructed her to stop targeting those high-prescribing physicians. \"My job was to be a sales rep. My job was not to figure out the red flags,\" she said on the witness stand. The role and responsibility of doctors Throughout the trial, Johnson & Johnson's defense team avoided many of the broader accusations made by the state, instead focusing on the question of whether the specific opioids manufactured by the company could have caused Oklahoma's high rates of addiction and deaths from overdose. Johnson & Johnson's lawyer, Larry Ottaway, argued the company's opioid products had a smaller market share in the state compared to other pharmaceutical companies, and he stressed that the company made every effort when the drugs were tested to prevent abuse. He also pointed out that the sale of both the raw ingredients and prescription opioids themselves are heavily regulated. \"This is not a free market,\" he said. \"The supply is regulated by the government.\" Ottaway maintained the company was addressing the desperate medical need of people suffering from debilitating, chronic pain \u2014 using medicines regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Even Oklahoma purchases these drugs, for use in state health care services. Next steps Judge Thad Balkman is expected to announce a verdict in August. If the state's claim prevails, Johnson & Johnson could, ultimately, have to spend billions of dollars in Oklahoma helping to ease the epidemic. State attorneys are asking that the company pay $17.5 billion over 30 years, to help abate\" the crisis in the state. Balkman could choose to award the full amount, or just some portion of it, if he agrees with the state's claim. \"You know, in some ways I think it's the right strategy to go for the $17 billion,\" Burch says. \"[The state is saying] look, the statute doesn't limit it for us, so we're going to ask for everything we possibly can.\" In the case of a loss, Johnson & Johnson is widely expected to appeal the verdict. If Oklahoma loses, the state will appeal, Attorney General Mike Hunter said Monday.

        "texts": "Tovia Smith is an award-winning NPR National Correspondent based in Boston, who's spent more than three decades covering news around New England and beyond. Most recently, she's reported extensively on the #MeToo movement and campus sexual assault. She's also covered breaking news from the Newtown school shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent trial, as well as the capture, trial and later death of Boston mobster James \"Whitey\" Bulger. She has provided extensive coverage of gay marriage, and the sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, including breaking the news of the Pope's secret meeting with survivors. Throughout the years, Smith has brought to air the distinct voices of Boston area residents, whether those demanding the ouster of Cardinal Bernard Law, or those mourning the death of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. In her reporting on contentious issues like race relations, abortion, and juvenile crime, her reporting always pushes past the polemics, and advances the national conversation with more thoughtful, and thought-provoking, nuanced arguments from both \u2014 or all \u2014 sides. Smith has traveled to New Hampshire to report on seven consecutive Primary elections, to the Gulf Coast after the BP oil spill, and to Ground Zero in New York City after the Sept. 11 attacks. With an empathic ear and an eye for detail, she tells the human stories that evoke the emotion and issues of the day. She has gone behind the bars of a prison to interview female prisoners who keep their babies with them while incarcerated, she's gone behind closed doors to watch a college admissions committee decide whom to admit, and she's embedded in a local orphanage to tell the stories of the children living there. Smith has also chronicled such personal tales as a woman's battle against obesity and a family's struggle to survive the recession of 2008. Throughout her career, Smith has won dozens of national journalism awards including a Gracie award, the Casey Medal, the Unity Award, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award Honorable Mention, Ohio State Award, Radio and Television News Directors Association Award, and numerous honors from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Public Radio News Directors Association, and the Associated Press. Smith took a leave of absence from NPR in 1998 to help create and launch Here and Now, a daily news magazine co-produced by NPR and WBUR in Boston. As co-host of the program, she conducted live daily interviews on issues ranging from the impeachment of President Bill Clinton to allegations of sexual abuse in Massachusetts prisons, as well as regular features as varied as a round-up of emerging tech and a listener call-in for advice on workplace survival. In 1996, Smith worked as a radio consultant and journalism instructor in Africa. She spent several months teaching and reporting in Ethiopia, Guinea, and Tunisia. She filed her first stories as an intern and then reporter for local affiliate WBUR in Boston beginning in 1987. She is a graduate of Tufts University, with a degree in international relations.

The language used in that tweet has a long history connected with nativist political movements. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption At a ceremony Monday at the White House, President Trump defended his racist tweets against Democratic lawmakers. The language used in that tweet has a long history connected with nativist political movements. When President Trump tweeted his racist remarks Sunday, asking why certain Democratic congresswomen don't just \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\" he did not just take aim at the four women of color \u2014 three of whom were born in the U.S. He did so using a taunt that has long, deeply entrenched roots in American history: Why don't you just go back where you came from? The question doesn't always appear in those precise words, nor does it always surface in the same situations. And it doesn't always get directed at the same groups of people \u2014 far from it, in fact. But more often than not, it conveys the same sentiment: You \u2014 and others like you \u2014 are not welcome here. \"There have been different phrases that have been used,\" says Michael Cornfield, a scholar of rhetoric at George Washington University, \"but the idea that we don't have any more room for people, or those people don't look like us, this is a long, ugly strain in American history.\" Jennifer Wingard, a University of Houston professor who has looked at rhetoric and immigrant communities, traces this sentiment at least to 1798, when the U.S. passed a series of laws \u2014 together known as the the Alien and Sedition Acts \u2014 that were aimed at making citizenship more difficult for immigrants and deportation easier for U.S. authorities to carry out. \"The legislation is actually constructed for the ability to remove immigrants who are saying things against the U.S. government,\" she says, explaining that these laws were passed in a tumultuous political climate. \"We were starting to see different political parties and different politicians arguing for different ways that the government should be run. And it just happened that politically, they could try to maintain and try to withhold the status quo by putting it on the backs of immigrants.\" Those laws established a pattern, she says, that would resurface with new waves of immigration and new perceived threats \u2014 from the Great Famine in Ireland and the Spanish-American War to the Great Depression and the attacks on Sept. 11. This cartoon, published around 1855, reflects the pervasive anti-Catholic sentiment of the era \u2014 perhaps best epitomized by the rise of the Know-Nothings, a nativist political party. Catholics, led by the pope, are depicted as an invading force of foreigners, rebuffed by a man dressed like Uncle Sam, who likens them to the anti-Christ. Nathaniel Currier/Library of Congress hide caption This cartoon, published around 1855, reflects the pervasive anti-Catholic sentiment of the era \u2014 perhaps best epitomized by the rise of the Know-Nothings, a nativist political party. Catholics, led by the pope, are depicted as an invading force of foreigners, rebuffed by a man dressed like Uncle Sam, who likens them to the anti-Christ. \"Every wave of immigration that gets in sees the next wave as the threat. That is the wave that is now going to take the jobs, that is now going to take things away,\" Wingard says. \"The latest flow in is always the one that seems the most threatening.\" Alan Kraut, a scholar at American University who is writing a history of anti-immigrant feeling in the U.S., says he saw this kind of thing play out firsthand when he was a child growing up in the Bronx. \"When kids had a fight in the street and the kids were from different ethnic groups, one kid would often say to the other: 'You and your parents go back where you came from,' \" Kraut recalls. \"You know, it could mean Brooklyn. But it could also mean go back where you came from \u2014 you know, Russian Jews who came to the United States, southern Italians who came to the United States, Puerto Ricans newly arrived,\" he continues. \"So when this came out of the mouth of this president who's from Queens, it sounded almost like a child saying that in my memory on the streets of New York.\" The process renews often, Wingard says, and she says the sentiment remains steady even if the names of the targeted groups change. A cartoon, published in 1891, titled \"Where the Blame Lies.\" shows a man gesturing toward a crowd of immigrants \u2014 including the \"German socialist,\" \"Italian brigand\" and \"English convict.\" The gesturing man tells a sagging Uncle Sam: \"If Immigration was properly Restricted you would no longer be troubled with Anarchy, Socialism, the Mafia and such kindred evils!\" Sackett & Wilhelms Litho.

A palimpsest, she explains, is a text that has been erased and overwritten \u2014 but that nevertheless continues to bear many of the markings and meanings largely concealed beneath the new writing. \"They carry these sentiments that we have seen over centuries, but then they get repurposed for the current moment \u2014 and a phrase like that [racist taunt] becomes almost like a shorthand for anti-immigrant sentiment,\" Wingard says. \"You know, 'go back where you came from' is the same as 'go back to your own country' is the same as 'you are not allowed here' is the same as 'no immigrants allowed.' Yet it carries all of this historical shorthand with it.\" Cornfield says it's partly the statement's variability that makes it so powerful. \"It plays to the fear that somehow America is getting too full or that the mixing of ethnicities and races would somehow aggravate issues,\" he says. \"It's a potent phrase and part of its potency is its ambiguity.\" It's simplicity, too. \"When you use a phrase like this, you're just asking people to forget about context and forget about policy choices,\" he adds, \"and just get angry at people who don't look or sound like you do.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Office of Inspector General hide caption The Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security observed overcrowding of families on June 10 at a detention center in McAllen, Texas. The OIG issued a blistering report raising concerns that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to DHS agents and detainees. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General is warning about \"dangerous overcrowding\" in Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. In a strongly worded report, the inspector general said the prolonged detention of migrants without proper food, hygiene or laundry facilities \u2014 some for more than a month \u2014 requires \"immediate attention and action.\" The report comes amid growing outrage over detention conditions for migrants and follows reports that migrant children were kept in squalid conditions without enough food and basic necessities in a Border Patrol station in West Texas. Inspectors from DHS's Office of Inspector General in June visited Border Patrol facilities and ports of entry across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest sector in the country for illegal border crossings. \"We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,\" they wrote. In its response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security says the surge of migrants crossing the Southern border has led to an \"acute and worsening crisis.\" \"The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond,\" DHS says. In May, according to DHS, an average of more than 4,600 people a day crossed illegally or arrived at ports of entry without the proper documents, compared to less than 700 a day in the same period two years ago. DHS says Customs and Border Protection facilities are at \"peak capacity\" and that the agency is adding detention capacity at three tent facilities in order to improve the conditions for migrants. CBP also says it \"continues to take steps to address the health and safety of those in custody,\" including by expanding medical services. The inspector general's office released a report in May describing similarly dangerous overcrowding conditions in Border Patrol cells in the El Paso region. The latest report from the Rio Grande Valley includes photos of migrants penned into overcrowded Border Patrol facilities \u2014 including one man pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word \"Help.\" The inspectors quote one unnamed senior manager calling the situation a \"ticking time bomb.\" Inspectors found that hundreds of children were held for longer than the 72 hours, the maximum time federal rules allow. In some cases, kids were held for more than two weeks. And some adults were kept in standing-room-only cells, without access to showers, for more than a week. Inspectors said Border Patrol management informed them there had been \"security incidents,\" such as detainees clogging toilets with Mylar blankets and socks in order to be released from their cells during maintenance. \"We ended our site visit at one Border Patrol facility early because our presence was agitating an already difficult situation,\" the inspectors wrote. \"Specifically, when detainees observed us, they banged on the cell windows, shouted, pressed notes to the window with their time in custody, and gestured to evidence of their time in custody (e.g., beards).\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

When Labor Secretary Alex Acosta steps down on July 19, his deputy Patrick Pizzella will step in as acting head of the department. The acting secretary will have some company. The Defense Department is currently led by acting Secretary Mark Esper, who is expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has been managing the humanitarian crisis at the border and enacting Trump's immigration policies. He also has acting deputies in key DHS agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many other key agencies are also led by acting officials, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 even the president's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is in an acting role. As NPR previously reported, the Trump administration has seen historic turnover. The number of acting officials also means a diminished role for Congress, because various departments and agencies are being led by officials who were not confirmed for their jobs by the Senate.

Updated at 7:40 p.m. ET A House panel heard at times emotional testimony about conditions at facilities run by the Department of Homeland Security. The hearing of the House oversight committee grew heated as Democrats and Republicans on the panel argued over who bore responsibility for the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at detention centers on the southern border. Republican lawmakers who represent border districts and Democratic lawmakers who have recently traveled to the border each testified. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., disputed charges that some of those being held at a Border Patrol facility in Texas were forced to drink water from toilets. \"Please, American public,\" Lesko said, \"there is no one asking people to drink out of toilets.\" She referred to a video from the Arizona Border Patrol showing an agent touring a facility and drinking water from a sink above a toilet unit. But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who made that accusation in a news conference after visiting a Texas CBP facility earlier this month, stood by her claim. After taking the unusual step of asking to be sworn in before testifying \u2014 something not required of the lawmakers \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez said when some of the women being held at the facility said they were told to drink from a toilet because the sink was broken, \"I believe these women.\" Credit: AP Ocasio-Cortez said there were American flags hanging at all of these facilities. \"That children being separated from their parents in front of an American flag, that women were being called these names under an American flag,\" she said. \"We cannot allow for this.\" The panel also heard testimony from the Department of Homeland Security's acting inspector general, Jennifer Costello, whose office found \"serious overcrowding and prolonged detention in Border Patrol facilities requiring immediate attention.\" The findings are detailed in a report released earlier this month. The committee released its own report on Friday, charging the Trump administration's child separation policy is \"more harmful, traumatic, and chaotic than previously known.\" The Director of Columbia Law School's Immigrants' Rights Clinic Elora Mukherjee spoke about the dozens of detained children whom she and her colleagues interviewed in June at the Clint Border Patrol facility in Texas. \"I was and I remain shaken to my core by what I witnessed at Clint,\" said Mukherjee, who has been working with detained families and children on the southern border for 12 years. Credit: AP Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting Director Thomas Homan told the panel, \"The biggest problem involves the unwillingness of Congress to address the loopholes that are causing this crisis.\" He said calls for action have been met by deaf ears. \"It's about [an] open borders agenda, resisting our president \u2014 more interest in that than securing our border,\" he said. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said, \"There is no excuse for how we are treating children. Is there no limit to what you will justify in this administration when it comes to the mistreatment of our fellow human beings?\" Credit: AP When Homan tried to respond to Connolly, the two shouted over each other. Homan said later, \"This is political theater at its best.\" Meanwhile, Vice President Pence traveled to McAllen, Texas, where he visited a CBP holding station. According to a pool report, he told reporters he \"couldn't be more proud of the CBP agents at the facility, and that every American would be proud. \"Every family I spoke to said they were being well cared for,\" he said, decrying the \"harsh rhetoric\" of Democrats. Pence said the overcrowding demonstrates why immigration laws needed to be changed. Later in the evening, the vice president and pool reporters with him went to a section of the McAllen Border station with almost 400 men stood in caged fences. Pool reporter Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post said the \"stench was overwhelming.\" VP saw 384 men sleeping inside fences, on concrete w/no pillows or mats. They said they hadn\u2019t showered in weeks, wanted toothbrushes, food. Stench was overwhelming. CBP said they were fed regularly, could brush daily & recently got access to shower (many hadn\u2019t for 10-20 days.) pic.twitter.com/tHFZYxJF7C Pence later said he was \"not surprised by what I saw.\" \"I knew we'd see a system that was overwhelmed,\" Pence said, according to the pool report. \"This is tough stuff.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Cedar Attanasio/AP hide caption Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, speaks alongside members of the Hispanic Caucus after touring the Border Patrol station in Clint, Texas, on Monday. Customs and Border Protection has launched an investigation into a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents in which members posted derogatory remarks targeting migrants and lawmakers. The group, which called itself \"I'm 10-15\" \u2014 a reference to the Border Patrol code for \"aliens in custody\" \u2014 was revealed Monday by ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization, as a delegation of Democratic congressional lawmakers toured three migrant detention facilities in southwestern Texas. Among the group's most offensive posts were discussions of recent migrant deaths, including that of a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy who died in May while he was in Border Patrol custody in Texas. Other posts joked about throwing burritos at lawmakers visiting its facilities. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who were both part of the delegation, were also targets of the group. Members referred to the women as \"scumbags\" and on multiple occasions posted graphic illustrations falsely depicting Ocasio-Cortez performing a sex act. \"These posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see\u2014and expect\u2014from our agents day in and day out,\" Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said in an emailed statement. She added that any employees who have violated the agency's standards of conduct \"will be held accountable.\" Matthew Klein, assistant commissioner at the CBP, said that after learning of the \"disturbing social media activity,\" the agency immediately informed the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation. Border Patrol has come under intense scrutiny for its treatment of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. as the Trump administration has moved to implement more aggressive measures to curb the surge of migrants at the border. Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, condemned the online group, following a tour of the Border Patrol's Clint facility. \"That was a vulgar, disgusting and vile page,\" he told reporters. \"That shows, unfortunately, that there are many within CBP who've become desensitized to the point of being dangerous to the migrants in their care.\" Castro added: \"It shocks the conscience that these agents are entrusted with the lives of anybody in their custody.\" The Clint shelter became a flashpoint last month for critics of the Trump administration's policies over how it treats unaccompanied migrant children. A group of lawyers who visited the Border Patrol-run facility said roughly 300 children were being detained in filthy conditions with no access to showers or personal hygiene products and with little food, for weeks at a time. On Monday, The Associated Press released video of an unidentified girl talking about her experience there after she was reunited with her mother. She said hundreds of children were mistreated by the people who were meant to care for them; children were denied showers and had to sleep on the floor, often sharing blankets, she said. Last week, Congress passed a $4.6 billion emergency aid package to improve conditions at temporary shelters housing migrants.

Here she testifies on Capitol Hill on March 6. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving her post, President Trump announced Sunday. Here she testifies on Capitol Hill on March 6. Updated at 11:17 p.m. ET Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving her post, President Trump announced Sunday as he continues to focus on restricting border crossings amid a recent surge. Nielsen had recently warned a congressional panel of a \"catastrophe\" on the southern border after the number of crossings hit a 10-year high. Trump confirmed the news in a tweet, saying, \"I would like to thank her for her service.\" Trump said Kevin McAleenan, the current commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, would serve as acting secretary. Nielsen said Sunday night that she will stay on through Wednesday. The change at the top comes with other uncertainty over management at the Department of Homeland Security. The president on Friday dropped his nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald Vitiello, telling reporters, \"We want to go in a tougher direction.\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service.... Trump's own response to the situation at the border in recent days has been frenetic. First, he threatened to close the southern border as soon as last week. Then, he backed off that threat and issued a new one, saying he would put hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico if the country did not do more to stop the flow of migrants as well as drugs coming north. He gave Mexico a \"one-year warning.\" Often the primary person working to turn Trump's harsh immigration rhetoric into policy, Nielsen was under intense scrutiny. As recently as March, she faced tough questioning from House Democrats over the treatment of migrants, especially children, at the southern border. Nielsen is Trump's second secretary of homeland security, taking over the cabinet post in December 2017 after John Kelly became White House chief of staff. Nielsen had worked as a top aide to Kelly at both DHS and the White House. Her tenure was marked throughout by tensions with Trump, who reportedly lashed out at her several times because illegal border crossings have not been stopped. Nielsen faced more public pressure after the Trump administration enacted a policy of family separation that resulted in thousands of migrant children being separated from their parents, which the president ultimately reversed. In her resignation letter posted on Twitter, Nielsen alluded to her rocky tenure. Its been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. pic.twitter.com/lIQ5iqGDmF \"Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,\" wrote Nielsen. \"I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws that have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse.\" Democrats, who have been critical of Nielsen's actions at DHS throughout her time there, said her departure showed that Trump's immigration policy was too extreme. \"When even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for President Trump, you know he's completely lost touch with the American people,\" said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Through lies, misdirection and rationalizations, Nielsen defended the indefensible and presided over policies, including family separation, that will live in infamy,\" Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group, said in a statement. Sharry added that he does not expect the administration to back off its hardline approach to immigration policy. \"While she will not be missed, we have no illusions that her replacement will usher in a brighter day at DHS.\" Facing a \"breaking point\" The number of migrants apprehended at the border jumped to more than 100,000 last month, the biggest monthly total in more than a decade. As the weather warms up, immigration authorities warn that the flow of migrants crossing the border will continue to grow, possibly reaching as high as 150,000 per month. While illegal border crossings are still far below the highs seen two decades ago, administration officials have warned that the current surge has led to a humanitarian crisis and put the immigration system at a \"breaking point.\" That's because the majority of migrants arriving now are families and children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. Unlike individual migrants looking for work, many of these migrants are seeking asylum and must be allowed to pursue their claims in immigration court. Overwhelmed by the influx, Customs and Border Protection has begun releasing more families with a notice to appear in immigration court instead of first handing them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for processing and detention. Nielsen tried to shift resources within her department to help with processing the migrants and last week appointed a Border Patrol veteran to serve as coordinator of the department's response to the \"border crisis.\" \"I want to be clear with the American people: there is an unprecedented emergency at the southern border, and DHS is leading a true government-wide emergency response,\" Nielsen said in a statement announcing the move. Nielsen also joined President Trump in calling on Congress to close what they call \"loopholes\" in immigration law to make it easier to detain and deport migrant families and kids. On defense with Trump \u2014 and for him Throughout her tenure, Trump blamed Nielsen for an inability to get Congress to fully fund a wall on the southern U.S. border with Mexico, even though she was not involved in the spending deal Trump reached with congressional leaders earlier in 2018. The border wall funding question led to a stalemate that caused the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history \u2014 with the president following through on threats not to sign critical spending bills unless he got what he deemed sufficient funding for his border wall and with congressional Democrats rejecting any legislation that would provide such funding. Trump ultimately took the highly unusual step of declaring a national emergency in order to go around Congress to secure more border wall funding, a move that Democrats are challenging in court. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized Nielsen for policies she advocated that actively sought to separate children from their parents at the border, including a protest inside a Mexican restaurant in Washington where the secretary was eating dinner last June. \"The law says if you cross between the ports of entry, you are entering without inspection and that is a crime,\" Nielsen said, defending herself in an interview with NPR's John Burnett in May 2018. \"Our policy has not changed in that if you break the law, we will refer you for prosecution,\" she added. \"What that means, however, is if you are a single adult, if you are part of a family, if you are pregnant, if you have any other condition, you're an adult and you break the law, we will refer you. Operationally what that means is we will have to separate your family.\" The administration backed away from that policy after a public outcry and in light of court rulings \u2014 just days after Nielsen had mounted a vigorous public defense of the controversial policy. Nielsen had to defend Trump on other issues, too. In January 2018, a little over a month after she was sworn in as DHS secretary, Nielsen testified to a Senate panel that she had not heard Trump describe some African nations as \"shithole countries,\" although she conceded that he had used \"tough language\" in a meeting on immigration issues that included members of Congress who insisted Trump had, in fact, used the pejorative. Months later, in response to a reporter's question, she said she \"was not aware of\" reports from U.S. intelligence agencies that concluded that the Russian government actively tried to swing the 2016 presidential election to Trump and away from Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nielsen's characterization of the foreign interference threat to U.S. elections evolved: She later said that although it continued to happen, it was not taking place with the same intensity as it had in 2016. DHS and other agencies released a statement ahead of Election Day 2018 that said the focus of foreign influence operations was on disinformation via social media platforms and less on cyberattacks aimed at stealing embarrassing information about political targets or disrupting the actual working of elections.

Thousands of asylum-seekers are waiting in Mexican border cities like Juarez right now, hoping for their turn to legally cross the border and make their case in court. A crowd has gathered outside Centro de Atenci\u00f3n Integral a Migrantes in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where migrants come to check their number on a long list of asylum seekers. Most days, a Mexican official calls several numbers off the waiting list here, and a lucky few get to cross the international bridge. These migrants are just some of the thousands of asylum-seekers staying in Mexican border cities right now, waiting for their turn to legally cross the border and make their case in court. Right now, U.S. immigration officers limit the number of asylum seekers allowed into ports of entry each day. It's scorching here \u2013 over 100 degrees. A woman is selling ice-cold soda and water from a small cooler. People fan out on benches under big, shady trees, trying to avoid the sun. The Trump administration's new asylum rule has hit this group particularly hard. To qualify for asylum, the rule says, most migrants must have applied for protection in another country they traveled through before arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Orlando, an asylum-seeker from Cuba, says he's been here for three months. He only gave his first name because he worries speaking out could hurt his asylum case. Orlando says he's been playing by these rules, and it's unfair that they're changing now. \"People get in line, everything is very regulated,\" he says. \"And now comes this, that you have to have political asylum in a third country.\" But he says that's not really an option. \"Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras. ... What kind of asylum can they offer and how can people be safe there?\" he said. Immigrant advocates say those countries can be dangerous and their governments can't protect these migrants. But the Department of Homeland Security says many of their asylum claims are \"meritless.\" And officials say they are trying to discourage migrants from making the treacherous journey through Central America and Mexico. But that's little comfort to the migrants already gathered in Juarez. Enrique Valenzuela, with the state government in Chihuahua, Mexico, helps maintain the waiting list for asylum-seekers. Mallory Falk/KERA hide caption Enrique Valenzuela, with the state government in Chihuahua, Mexico, helps maintain the waiting list for asylum-seekers. Enrique Valenzuela is with the state government in Chihuahua, Mexico, and helps maintain the waiting list for asylum-seekers. \"The information for them is, of course, unsettling,\" he said. \"They have been waiting for two or three months ... and they believe that maybe they shouldn't have been waiting.\" Valenzuela says he's not entirely sure how the new asylum rule will affect the migrants in Mexico. And he says it's hard not to have any answers for them. He only heard about the rule change on Monday \u2014 it went into effect Tuesday. \"They have trusted the local authorities and this list system has gained a lot of credibility among the people who are willing to wait,\" Valenzuela said. He says there are currently some 5,000 people on the waiting list, though he said he suspects some have returned home or tried to cross a different part of the border. The irony, he says, is that this new rule doesn't apply to migrants who already crossed illegally instead of waiting at a port of entry. For Orlando, the Cuban asylum seeker waiting in Juarez, he says there's a lot of uncertainty. But for now, he's keeping his name on the waiting list and hoping something changes. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued to try and block the new asylum rule, saying the Trump administration overstepped its authority. \"Until it's gone through Congress or a judge has ruled on it, it's just a thing Trump has put into place,\" Orlando says. He plans to wait in place until all that plays out. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

But it's a constant source of worry for his family, who fled Guatemala earlier this year. The boy, Jonathan, lost his eye to a tumor when he was a toddler.

He lost his eye to a tumor when he was a toddler. Now he needs medicine to keep the eye clean. Giovani says that care has been hard for the family to get in Juarez, the border town across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. And they're afraid to leave their church-run shelter to find care in this Mexican city where crime is rampant and migrants are targeted. More than 15,000 migrants \u2014 including roughly 5,000 children \u2014 have been returned to Juarez and other border cities under the so-called \"Remain In Mexico\" policy. The migrants are waiting in those cities for their day in U.S. immigration courts. While U.S. citizens are frequently warned by the State Department not to visit these border cities out of safety concerns, that's exactly where thousands of migrants are amassing after being returned to Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security says it will make exceptions for \"vulnerable\" migrants on a case-by-case basis. Its own guidance states that migrants with \"known physical/mental health issues\" should not be sent back to Mexico under the new policy. It seems like a joke. My family did everything right. Giovani But in practice, migrant advocates say, that's exactly what's happening. \"It seems like a joke,\" said Giovani, who asked that we not use his family's last name because he worries that speaking out would hurt his immigration case. \"My family did everything right. We didn't hop over the fence or cross the river. But despite all that they're still sending everybody back,\" he said. Giovani's says his family left Guatemala when his coffee farm failed, gangs tried to extort him, and the medical bills got to be too much. They waited months for a chance to legally enter the United States at a port of entry, and ask for asylum. Giovani says he explained his son's medical needs to U.S. immigration officials in El Paso. But it didn't make any difference. \"It's a sham, just to say they gave them a chance,\" said Edith Tapia, an activist with the Hope Border Institute, a non-profit that works with migrants in Juarez and El Paso.

She says U.S. officials have given very little information about the program that's known as \"Remain in Mexico.\" Tapia says U.S. officials have provided very little information about the program that's officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, and have not clarified who qualifies for an exemption. \"'Vulnerable populations' has been kind of vague,\" Tapia said. \"They've used the example of members of the LGBTQ community. They've used kids or anyone with health issues. Sometimes pregnant women with certain conditions. But we've seen all of those cases be in MPP.\" In some cases, immigrant advocates say, transgender women, pregnant women, and parents of children with special needs have been removed from MPP. But decisions on whether to include or exclude these groups have been \"inconsistent,\" according to a recent report Human Rights Watch. \"Attorneys arguing for other pregnant women to be excluded from the MPP have seen them returned to Mexico,\" the report said. We also asked the Homeland Security Department to clarify who is eligible for an exemption. But a spokeswoman did not respond to our questions. \"Remain in Mexico\" is supposed to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed immigration system in the U.S., while discouraging what the administration calls \"meritless\" asylum claims. And the number of migrants taken into custody after crossing the southern border did decline last month, for the first time all year. \"It appears that the implementation of MPP is easing at least some of the problem in some parts of the border,\" said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in an interview with MSNBC earlier this month. The agency Cuccinelli runs, USCIS, has set up a system for migrants to ask to be removed from MPP if they're afraid of returning to Mexico \u2014 migrants like Giovani, the Guatemalan father we met in Juarez. Giovani met with an asylum officer, and tried to make a case for his family, to explain why they should be able to wait for their court hearings in the U.S. Giovani says the migrant shelter where they're staying is being monitored by a local gang. A corpse was found recently found in the street outside the shelter. \"Here in Juarez we didn't feel safe because five days before our appointment, there was a murder outside the shelter,\" Giovani said. He also told the asylum officer about his son's eye, and his difficulties finding care for him. But once again, he says, it didn't matter. \"I feel the asylum officer ignored me,\" Giovani said. \"The asylum officer essentially said, 'If you've been able to survive in Juarez for the last few months, you can do it again.'\" Activists says hundreds of migrants have requested these interviews, but that only a handful have been removed from the \"Remain in Mexico\" program.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption In a new book, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens says we should rewrite the Second Amendment, abolish the death penalty and restrict political campaign spending. Just a few words can hold a world of meaning. John Paul Stevens, the retired Supreme Court justice, has written a short new book in which he proposes a few words here and there that would create some sweeping changes. The book, Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution, details the half-dozen ways Stevens thinks the Constitution could be improved, changes that he says are worth the trouble of the arduous amendment process. To start, he proposes changing the First Amendment, the protection of free speech, so that it allows \"reasonable limits\" on the amount of money candidates for public office or their supporters can spend on election campaigns. Stevens would add words to the Second Amendment to read, \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms when serving in the militia shall not be infringed.\" He would also end the death penalty, adding it to the prohibitions on \"excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment.\" How and Why We Should Change the Constitution by John Paul Stevens Hardcover, 177 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? \"I think in time that what I have to say about each of these six issues will be accepted as being consistent with what the framers really intended in the first place,\" Stevens tells NPR's Scott Simon. \"I think in time, reason will prevail.\" On whether the quality of free speech is different when it's directed in a political campaign than in the ordinary course of events Not necessarily the quality, but the permissibility of regulations of speech is quite different because of a very strong state interest in trying to establish equality of opportunity for competing candidates to get elected. On the Supreme Court's ruling this week saying that voters could elect to end affirmative action programs It's a very interesting case, and I haven't completely finished reading it, but a quite different issue than I thought it was. The case is not about whether affirmative action itself is a good idea or a bad idea, should be permissible. It's rather about the question of the way in which the state changed its law, whether they followed a procedure that violated a series of cases that say legislatures may not enact laws that are designed to make it more difficult for minorities to achieve their own goals. And the question here is really whether this was such a law or not. There really isn't much argument about whether affirmative action is a good thing or a bad thing. On whether marijuana use should be legal under federal law Yes. Public opinion has changed and recognized that the distinction between marijuana and alcoholic beverages is really not much of a distinction. There's a general consensus that the prohibition against selling and dispensing alcoholic beverages was not worth the cost, and I think really, in time, that'll be the general consensus with respect to this particular drug. It's really a very similar problem to the whole problem on Prohibition. Of course, I lived through that, part of that period. On whether term limits should be imposed on Supreme Court justices No, I really don't think so. I think that the Supreme Court justices over the years have demonstrated an ability to recognize when it's time for them to retire.

Danny Johnston/AP hide caption Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said the Second Amendment is \"a relic\" and should be repealed. Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, responding to this past weekend's March For Our Lives events across the nation, is proposing what some might call a radical solution to prevent further gun violence \u2014 repealing the Second Amendment. In an op-ed in Tuesday's New York Times, the 97-year-old Stevens writes that a constitutional amendment \"to get rid of\" the Second Amendment \"would do more to weaken the N.R.A.'s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.\" The Second Amendment states that \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Stevens called that concern \"a relic of the 18th century\" and says repealing it would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States. Stevens, who retired from the court in 2010, had two years earlier dissented in District of Columbia v. Heller, which determined the Second Amendment allowed an individual right to bear arms. Stevens says he remains convinced that decision was wrong and debatable and provided the National Rifle Association with \"a propaganda weapon of immense power.\" Stevens' call for repeal of the Second Amendment goes further than most gun control advocates, many of whom have called for banning certain types of weapons and establishing stricter background checks and age limits but for not changing the Constitution. Stevens' proposal immediately lit up Twitter and social media. I admire Justice Stevens but his supposedly \u201csimple but dramatic\u201d step of repealing the 2d Am is AWFUL advice. The obstacle to strong gun laws is political, not legal. Urging a politically impossible effort just strengthens opponents of achievable reform.https://t.co/7VzMGXCYeV At least one of the Parkland, Fla., students, Cameron Kasky, reacted to Stevens' op-ed arguing it was \"very interesting considering who wrote it,\" but \"I don't feel the same way.\" A mass shooting last month at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland left 17 people dead and is the catalyst for the \"March for Our Lives\" movement. https://t.co/JcFNFTA6VD Not what we\u2019re going for here, but very interesting considering who wrote it. Feel free to give it a read. I don\u2019t feel the same way, but it\u2019s an interesting point of view. While Stevens claimed such an action would \"be simple,\" it likely would be anything but. Amending the Constitution requires securing two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate \u2014 and then three-fourths of the states would have to ratify the amendment. Our colleague Ron Elving has much more on the many barriers to amending the Constitution here. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

AP hide caption April 9, 2010 \u2022 During his 34 years on the Supreme Court, Justice John Paul Stevens became a brilliant tactician, forging unexpected majorities that established new legal rules on issues ranging from the death penalty to national security. Although the retiring justice dislikes the description, he is considered the leader of the court's liberal faction. April 9, 2010 \u2022 Justice John Paul Stevens authored some of the Supreme Court's most complex and important decisions. Though he often brought justices together to form unexpected majorities on a wide range of legal issues, he also dissented from the majority's rulings more frequently than any other justice. Here, a sampling of some of Stevens' key opinions \u2014 in the majority and in dissent. April 9, 2010 \u2022 Unfettered praise and grudging respect greeted Justice John Paul Stevens' announcement that he will retire this summer at age 90 after 35 years on the Supreme Court. Stevens' announcement, made 11 days before his 90th birthday, gives President Obama his second court opening to fill. April 9, 2010 \u2022 When a Supreme Court retirement is as widely anticipated as that of John Paul Stevens, the list of prospective successors is bound to be public. In this case, it's also remarkably short. Other prospects may emerge, but three names sure to be on the list are Solicitor General Elena Kagan and federal appeals judges Diane Wood and Merrick Garland. April 9, 2010 \u2022 After nearly 35 years on the U.S. Supreme Court, the leader of the liberal justices clears the way for Obama's second appointment. March 15, 2010 \u2022 Speculation is growing that Justice John Paul Stevens, the Supreme Court's longest-serving member, will step down in June. New Yorker legal correspondent Jeffrey Toobin discusses who is likely to replace Stevens \u2014 and offers his take on how the court will rule on the future of gun control laws.

In his new book, Six Amendments, he proposes constitutional changes including a curb on an individual's right to bear arms. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption Former Supreme Court Associate Justice John Paul Stevens likens making pot illegal to Prohibition. In his new book, Six Amendments, he proposes constitutional changes including a curb on an individual's right to bear arms. Retired Justice John Paul Stevens made some news in an interview with NPR's Scott Simon on Thursday. Scott asked him if the federal government should legalize marijuana. \"Yes,\" Stevens replied. \"I really think that that's another instance of public opinion [that's] changed. And recognize that the distinction between marijuana and alcoholic beverages is really not much of a distinction. Alcohol, the prohibition against selling and dispensing alcoholic beverages has I think been generally, there's a general consensus that it was not worth the cost. And I think really in time that will be the general consensus with respect to this particular drug.\" Stevens' comments are perhaps not particularly surprising. Stevens was, after all, considered part of the court's liberal wing. But he was appointed by President Gerald Ford and he considers himself a conservative. Also, just years ago a pronouncement of this kind would have been a bombshell. Just think back to 1987, when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg to the high court. Nine days later, after Ginsburg admitted that he had smoked marijuana, he asked Reagan to withdraw his nomination. The 94-year-old Stevens has been making waves recently with a new book, Six Amendments, in which he proposes six changes to the U.S. Constitution. Among them: the banishment of capital punishment, a limit on the amount of corporate money that can be pumped into elections and a curb on the individual right to bear arms. Scott also asked Stevens about gay marriage. Stevens says that the dramatic shift in public opinion on that issue gives him confidence that \"in due course when people actually think through the issues they'll be willing to accept the merits of some of my arguments.\" Much more of Scott's conversation with Stevens will air on Weekend Edition Saturday.

The Justices were participating in a panel discussion of government and the courts. Federal Circuit Judge John Paul Stevens waits to testify during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 8, 1975. AP hide caption Federal Circuit Judge John Paul Stevens waits to testify during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 8, 1975. Justice John Paul Stevens, who announced Friday that he will step down from the Supreme Court when the justices break for the summer, started out his time on the nation's mightiest bench as something of a maverick. But during his 34 years of service, which ranks him among the longest-serving justices in U.S. history, Stevens became a brilliant tactician, forging unexpected majorities that established new legal rules on issues ranging from the death penalty to national security. Appointed to the court by President Gerald Ford, he became the leader of the court's liberal wing when the court's composition changed and moved increasingly to the right. Today, with the court split 5-4 on many issues, Stevens \u2014 who is the current court's oldest member \u2014 is most often in the minority, so the nomination of another liberal in his place would not change the ideological makeup of the court. 'An Accident Of History' Often called \"a judge's judge,\" Stevens was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, \"law and politics were a noble pursuit, not a blood sport.\" The quintessential Midwesterner, Stevens was born in Chicago and educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and, later, appeals court judge. 1 of 6 In 1975, Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike, and Stevens was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. Given Stevens' lack of political ties, his rise was to some extent a fluke, according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan. \"It was an accident of history,\" Sloan says. \"The stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment.\" A brand new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill, and with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law. Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissent to the court's 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also picked for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican, with no record of political or judicial activism. Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence. Unlike other justices, he even declined to attend State of the Union addresses. In his first decade, he was seen as a center-right justice, but as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member, a moniker he has never liked, according to fellow Chicagoan Abner Mikva, who served 15 years as a federal judge himself. \"It bothers him a great deal whenever he hears himself portrayed as a liberal,\" Mikva says. \"When we're together, he looks at me playfully and says, 'Now, Ab, you know I'm not a liberal.' And I do.\" No Person Is Above The Law Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to the death penalty, from school prayer to campaign finance, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it, \"the crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident.\" The decisions Stevens is likely to be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-3 decision repudiating President Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004 he authorized the court's 6-3 decision allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones, the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. Born: April 20, 1920, in Chicago. Stevens' father, Ernest, built the Stevens Hotel, the largest hotel in the world at the time. Education: University of Chicago, A.B., 1941; Northwestern University School of Law, 1947. He served as editor-in-chief for the law review at Northwestern. Married: Elizabeth Sheeren, with whom he has four children; they divorced in 1979. Stevens married Maryann Simon in 1980. Military: Earned a Bronze Star while he was enlisted in the Navy during World War II. Early Career: After law school, Stevens clerked for Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge and later worked at a Chicago law firm that specialized in antitrust cases. On The Bench: Appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit by President Nixon. In 1975, he was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ford. Stevens was unanimously approved by the Senate. Sources: News reports; Encyclopaedia Britannica; oyez.org \"In the entire history of the republic,\" he said, \"only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions.\" And as for Clinton's case, \"there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly.\" As a former Stevens law clerk put it, \"the justice just thought if the president had time to play golf, he had time to defend a lawsuit.\" Critics thought Stevens' view naive \u2014 the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And indeed, as it turned out, the Paula Jones case led directly to Clinton's impeachment. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system \u2014 that no person is above the law. Frequent Dissenter Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together under one legal tent justices one might not expect to agree. But he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens, the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star, objected. \"A country's flag is a symbol of more than 'nationhood and national unity,' \" Stevens wrote. \"It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem, as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas.\" When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, he took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench when the court struck down a key section of the Brady gun control law that imposed a short waiting period on gun buyers to allow local law enforcement officials to run a criminal records check. \"The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties,\" he said. \"Since the ultimate issue is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency,\" as well as the ramifications of preventing national action on matters such as the need for mass inoculation to forestall an epidemic or the threat of terrorism. Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later, when he managed to eke out a 5-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. \"Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program,\" he said. The rule announced today, that Congress must treat corporations like human speakers in the political realm, represents a radical change in the law. The court's decision is at war with the views of generations of Americans. Stevens, dissenting in the court's 2010 decision striking down a 100-year-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections Court Maverick This year, though, Stevens' victories were few, as the court grew more and more conservative. In January, when a five-justice majority struck down a 100-year-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections, Stevens blasted the conservative majority in a 90-page dissent. \"The rule announced today, that Congress must treat corporations like human speakers in the political realm, represents a radical change in the law,\" he said in a dissent from the bench. \"The court's decision is at war with the views of generations of Americans.\" It was a dissent as angry as the one he wrote in Bush v. Gore. \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election,\" he wrote in 2000, \"the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law.\" Sloan, the onetime law clerk, sees the Bush v. Gore and Clinton v. Jones opinions as flip sides of the same coin. \"He has a very deep respect for the crucible of litigation,\" says Sloan. \"And in both cases, what he was strongly objecting to was the suggestion that there be some kind of arbitrary shortcut.\" In the Clinton case, the shortcut would have been to delay a trial, and the court unanimously rejected that. In Bush v. Gore, the shortcut was to remove the case from the Florida state courts, where vote-count cases are traditionally resolved, and Stevens bitterly objected. Not A 'Go Along' Judge Stevens' frequent dissents, as well as the separate opinions he often filed to note that his views differed from fellow justices, earned him a reputation as a maverick. But as he explained recently, his insistence on stating his views stemmed directly from his experience as, in effect, a special prosecutor more than 30 years ago, when he was appointed to investigate charges of misconduct against two sitting Illinois Supreme Court justices. What Stevens found was that the court opinion that had been improperly influenced was not, as the public record indicated, unanimous. Two justices had in fact dissented, but in the name of collegiality had not publicly noted their dissents. It's because of this incident, Stevens said, that when he became a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, he did not \"go along\" with colleagues in some cases. The fact that a justice disagrees with his colleagues is a matter of sufficient importance that the public is entitled to know, Stevens said. The judicial scandal investigation influenced Stevens in other ways. The man who made the initial charges against the two state Supreme Court justices was well known in Chicago as a less than reliable gadfly. And yet, on the cover of Kenneth Manaster's book about the probe, there is a picture of the gadfly, Sherman Skolnick, in his wheelchair, with Stevens at his side. \"Stevens is standing with his head bowed, listening very carefully to what this fellow, who many consider to be a kook, has to say,\" Manaster says. \"And I really love that picture, because it says to me that this is a man who wants to hear even a person who by that time was known to have close to zero credibility, but you never know. And this was an instance in which Skolnick got it right.\" It is for that reason that Stevens refused to join his Supreme Court colleagues in imposing penalties on people who repeatedly file frivolous appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 because you never know; sometime, someone might have a legitimate complaint. Influencing The Majority In that way and so many others, Stevens for decades marched to the tune of his own drummer. The question now is what tune his replacement will march to. Whomever the president chooses, it is doubtful that he or she will wield the kind of influence that Stevens did. At least not for some time. During his more than three decades on the court, Stevens became increasingly skilled at molding opinion to reach the magic number of five majority justices. One of his least-known efforts involved the machine that became ubiquitous in American homes: the TV video recorder. In the early 1980s, Hollywood tried to ban the devices and punish both the manufacturer and the home user with fines for copyright infringement. A majority of the court initially agreed with the filmmakers, but Stevens' proposed dissent turned the court around, and he ended up writing the court's 5-4 opinion declaring that VCRs did not violate copyright laws when used in the home to make a single copy for personal use. A decade later, Stevens would play a similarly pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. With the court closely divided, three justices \u2014 Sandra Day O'Connor (now retired), Anthony Kennedy and David Souter (also now retired) \u2014 circulated an opinion upholding what they called the core of Roe but making it easier for states to regulate abortions. The opinion split the court into three separate factions: four justices to reverse Roe, three to uphold its core and two to uphold it entirely. Stevens and Justice Harry Blackmun were the two. But upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority. O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter quickly agreed, and the opinion became the law of the land. These are just two examples of how Stevens, with the power of his intellect and the firm, respectful approach he took toward colleagues, moved the court in his direction. Putting together such victories became increasingly difficult after O'Connor's retirement, when the court moved dramatically to the right. But Stevens continued to score the occasional unexpected win \u2014 using his knowledge of the law, his powers of persuasion and logic and the wisdom of a man who will turn 90 on April 20.

        "title": "Democrat Calls For Investigation Into Viral Russian-Developed FaceApp : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST: If you've seen photos of friends or celebrities posting selfies with silver hair and wrinkles lately, it's not the relentless news cycle. They probably used FaceApp. The app can make your face look older, younger, even style your hair. It can be fun, but lawmakers warn users to take precaution. The Democratic National Committee warned presidential campaigns against using it, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on the FBI to investigate. He posted this on social media about FaceApp. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: It allows, quote, \"perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license to your photos, name or likeness.\" So this is a breathtaking and possibly dangerous level of access. SIMON: Louise Matsakis is a staff writer at Wired magazine and joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us. LOUISE MATSAKIS: Thanks for having me. SIMON: In your judgment, is FaceApp really more compromising than Facebook or Instagram, who have billions of users already? MATSAKIS: Absolutely not. I think that one thing to consider here is that this is a much smaller company, and Facebook has argued in the past that they're better at protecting your data because they, you know, inherently have more resources. But I don't think that this FaceApp is necessarily more controversial or troubling because it happens to be made by developers who are Russian. I think that's where kind of the anxiety from lawmakers comes from here. FaceApp, like a lot of these free apps, their business model's around advertising. You know, they're sending some of your data to the Google ad networks. That's what they want here. That doesn't mean it's not troubling for other reasons, but I think lawmakers here are maybe fixating on the wrong issue. SIMON: Why is it troubling for other reasons? MATSAKIS: I think we should be really careful about who we want to share our faces with. This information is really sensitive. It's not something, like Schumer pointed out, that they're going to get back to you. You know, they maintain the rights to these images, and they can do what they want with them. But the reality is we're sharing our facial recognition data with so many companies. And a lot of time, we don't have a lot of control over that. So it's really not just this app, even though it's, you know, called FaceApp, so it seems really literal. But when you upload pictures to dating sites, to Facebook, to, you know, photo-sharing sites like Flickr or Instagram, you're probably in a facial recognition database and you don't know it already. SIMON: I got to tell you. I've been taking pictures of our 16-year-old since she came into our lives. Is it already too late for her? MATSAKIS: Probably. And it's too late for what Georgetown University estimates is probably over half of Americans who are already in a facial recognition database as it stands. You know, that includes when you get a license, right? You know, that license database might be used by the government to create a facial recognition algorithm that includes maybe a dating profile that might be used to identify your gender or something. You know, researchers from Stanford in 2017 actually took photos from a dating network, and they used it to build a very controversial tool that claimed to identify people's sexuality just based on their photo. So, you know, the people who are on that dating site had no idea something like that was going to happen. SIMON: Do companies ever lose control of the data? I mean, that happens with credit card information all the time, doesn't it? MATSAKIS: Sure. And it's not even just losing control. A lot of time, these databases are widely available or they're made public to academic researchers and to corporations in order to foster more scholarship. So a lot of these photos are just out there even if there isn't a data breach to begin with. These big training sets are already available to a, you know, wide array of different actors who want to use them to build tools that they can use to do whatever they want. SIMON: Is there any way to stop this, any way to take steps, even if it's too late to protect your images? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think making sure that your profiles are not public is a good way of doing that. That's really hard because dating profiles, for instance, are inherently public, right? You want other people to see them. But I think really thinking about, do I need to upload this picture right now, is this worth the risk that it poses by uploading it, do I really need to post a lot of pictures of me maybe publicly on Twitter or something like that, or would I rather just have kind of a private Facebook group where I share pictures of my daughter? SIMON: Even if FaceApp isn't as dangerous as some political figures caution, is it good that this conversation - if you please - has been set off? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think this is really great that this conversation is centering on your face, which is such a valuable piece of data for these companies that are building these algorithms, often for troubling purposes, like law enforcement or that sort of thing, or identifying people and perhaps identifying you. And I think that's really an important part of this conversation, even though maybe this app is a little silly. SIMON: When you say it's troubling that law enforcement could use it, I mean, if you're looking for someone who committed a violent crime against someone you love, you're glad to have that technology. On the other hand, if you're a dissident in Hong Kong, you're not glad to have that technology. MATSAKIS: Exactly. I think these conversations always involve a trade-off between privacy and security. And we kind of haven't really figured out that balance with facial recognition data yet. And I think another concern is that a lot of these algorithms have been proven to be inaccurate. You know, people have been arrested for crimes... SIMON: Yeah. MATSAKIS: ...They didn't commit because the algorithm, you know, mistakenly identified them. So I think that's another piece that's really important here. SIMON: Louise Matsakis of Wired, thanks so much for being with us. MATSAKIS: Thanks again. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

        "texts": "Ron Elving People gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last month as decisions are handed down, including on the census. Mark Wilson/Getty Images hide caption People gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last month as decisions are handed down, including on the census. Day after day, you're seeing stories about the 2020 census on the front page and all over TV news, even though the once-a-decade head count is still months away. The president wants the census questionnaire to include: \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" He's willing to delay the count \"for as long as it takes\" to have it his way. Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020. I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the..... But Census Bureau officials say such a question will chill cooperation, suppress the count by millions and distort the relative populations of states. They say counting all persons present in the country has been the mission of the census since it was invented in the Constitution. States sued to block the citizenship question and in June the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it could only be added with proper justification. Chief Justice John Roberts said the justification the administration had offered \u2013 to help enforce the Voting Rights Act \u2013 was not supported by evidence. \"Contrived\" was the term he used. So now we have a court fight and a loud, cacophonous argument about racism and the rule of law on the other. And you can practically hear Americans asking: when did the census get so political? And the answer to that question is: Right from the start. The whole idea of the census originally was to decide how many seats each state would get in Congress. Each state would get two seats in the Senate, with the seats in the House of Representatives determined based on population. As the system evolved, the states also drew districts so the House members would represent the various parts of each state. State legislatures were apportioned and mapped in the same way. These vital functions of the democratic system have been triggered by each new census with remarkable regularity since 1790 \u2014 except that one time they weren't. The special case of the 1920 census It was just a century ago when the 1920 Census came in and the Congress chose to ignore it. The reasons were as political as they could be, and it was all about immigration and the rising power of the cities \u2014 tensions that persist in the present day census crisis as well. The problem was that the 1920 census had definitively proved that America had become an urban nation \u2013 and, more than ever, a nation of immigrants. Less than half the U.S. population still lived on farms, in rural areas or in towns smaller than 2,500. In a little more than a single generation, jobs and commerce and culture had lured millions to America's cities and metro areas. Many came from the countryside, many came from other countries \u2013 and both movements posed challenges to the establishment in Washington. The Congress of the early 1920s was still dominated by members elected from rural districts, reflecting the economics and politics of the previous century. These included Democrats from the rural South, but Republicans dominated the rural areas everywhere else and enjoyed clear majorities in both chambers of Congress. These incumbents in both parties knew that a reapportionment would cost some of their states seats. Beyond that, the subsequent redrawing of the districts would force individual members to compete with each other in a game of musical chairs. Moreover, the new seats to be created would be centered in the metro areas where city folk would people would vote for someone of their own. So these incumbents attacked the census as inaccurate, as well as insensate to the rural soul of the nation as they knew it. The agrarian worldview of Thomas Jefferson was still like religion to much of Congress. (Jefferson once wrote that \"The mobs of great cities add just as much to the support of pure government as sores do to the strength of the human body.\") Just as obvious as the growth of cities was the contribution immigrants were making to that growth. The percentage of foreign-born residents in the U.S. had spiked to a record high (13.5%) in the decade before 1920, and it was concentrated in the industrial metros of the Northeast and the Great Lakes. Republicans in Congress saw the arrival of immigrants as a direct threat. One member from Kansas had a chart suggesting that the counting of non-citizens nationally had an impact on the number of seats apportioned to 16 states. He proposed a constitutional amendment to bar the census from counting anyone who had not become a naturalized citizen. Members from Kentucky and Tennessee said they wanted to do the same. In response, the Republican leaders in Congress simply stalled the reapportionment bill that would have normally been enacted after the census. And they stalled it all the way through the next four congressional election cycles. It was not until 1929 that a reapportionment law was finally enacted \u2013 even as the 1930 census was being prepared. Roots of the contemporary controversy The original Constitution (Article I, Section 2) committed to a House of 65 seats, assigned to the states based on their relative, approximate population. Thus Virginia would have 10, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts eight each, and so on \u2013 down to Delaware and Rhode Island with one each. But the original ratio was just a starting point. The Constitution set in motion an \"actual enumeration\" of residents, and the first census takers rode out on horseback in 1790. All the other uses of the census we know today, from the distribution of federal program funds to the myriad commercial and academic purposes, came later. And they were all ancillary to the original idea of popular representation, an essential tool for a democratic republic. The census, and the apportionment of seats that followed, was a mechanism that also recognized the reality that the new nation was not one unit but a union of previously sovereign states. It was a contract among several separate entities that insisted on their own rights and identities. Given these origins, the census and reapportionment are inevitably controversial. Attendees at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 argued long and hard about how to count slaves, an issue that nearly caused the whole enterprise to collapse. In the end, the convention adopted the \"three-fifths compromise\" by which slaves would count in the census but only as three-fifths of a person. That compromise may seem shocking today. But in the America of 1787, it got the deal done. And it persisted until the Civil War brought the 13th and 14th Amendments and a mandate for \"counting the whole number of persons in each State.\" In the 20th Century, the census was a hot potato for other reasons. It figured in the measuring of unemployment during the Great Depression. It played a role in the efforts to redraw congressional districts within the states during the Civil Rights Movement. In the years before and after the census of 2000, more attention was paid to the under-counting of some groups \u2013 especially newer arrivals and people of color. Efforts to supplement the census \"nose count\" with statistical sampling and other contemporary techniques of social science met stiff resistance from Republicans in Congress. More recently, questions have been raised about the Census Bureau's definitions of terms such as marriage and family \u2014 and also its determinations of gender. And now, under the Trump administration, the census has once again come to focus on the issue of immigration. Many of the tensions of 1920 Census persist today Both the rural-urban tension and the immigration pressure of 1920 are palpable in the conflicts of the upcoming census. The distinction between voting patterns of metro and non-metro residents is stark. Exit polls in 2016 showed Trump receiving 62% of the vote in rural areas but just 35% in urban precincts. A national poll by Selzer & Co. for Grinnell College in December found corroborating evidence: Trump had 61% approval in rural areas and just 31% in urban (with suburbs and small towns in the low 40s). But the cutting edge of the census issue in our day is the immigration issue, as highlighted by the president's own emphasis on it. Trump first emerged from the pack of Republican candidates in 2015 by emphasizing his support for a border wall with Mexico and a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. until we figure out what the hell is going on.\" Frustrated so far in his efforts to build that wall, or to overhaul immigration law more generally, the president has looked for other ways to force the issue. These have included his challenge to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program benefiting those brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Most visible in recent days has been the policy of separating families of asylum-seekers at the Mexican border, and the controversies over the conditions in detention camps for children. Given the adverse public reaction to both these initiatives, the president may sense greater acceptance of his citizenship question on the census. And if denied the question by the courts, the president can surely make that a grievance to campaign on in 2020. This post was originally published on July 9, 2019.

Julius Constantine Motal/AP hide caption In New York City, hundreds of people march in Queens on Sunday in opposition to the Trump administration's plans to continue with raids to catch immigrants in the country illegally. President Trump's threatened roundup of undocumented immigrant families this weekend that set migrants in many communities on edge showed few signs of materializing on Sunday, the second time rumors of a large-scale immigration enforcement operation failed to come to fruition. Instead, in the cities where rumors of mass raids swirled, many immigrants stayed inside their homes, as jitters turned typically vibrant migrant markets and commercial corridors eerily quiet. Immigrant advocates across the country, meanwhile, took to the streets to protest the promised roundup. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not confirm any arrests, nor would immigrant rights activists. \"The ACLU has not heard reports of any raids today,\" Ruthie Epstein, the American Civil Liberties Union's deputy director for immigration policy, told NPR. Before Sunday, there were weekend reports of attempted arrests by ICE in New York, New Jersey and Chicago, where The New York Times reported that a mother and her daughters were apprehended, though the family was immediately released. But those actions appeared to be part of routine enforcement, not connected to a massive raid. Still, fears of ICE catching migrants by surprise sent many into hiding on Sunday. In Miami, one of the cities anticipating a crackdown, a hush fell over a market usually buzzing with activity among immigrant merchants and shoppers. \"People are clearly hiding. If you look around, it's the people who are working are basically the only people here. But the majority of our clients are immigrants. Some with papers, others with no papers, but they are all scared,\" Yohanna Gomez, a Honduran immigrant who runs a Central American stall at the market, told WLRN. A similar scene played out in in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, typically bustling with immigrants from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. But on Sunday, the streets were noticeably calmer, and vendors seemed to have taken the day off, possibly because of the threatened raids. A couple of hundred demonstrators at #abolishICE march now in Jackson Heights, Queens @WNYC pic.twitter.com/v4nnhYMWdN New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday that ICE officers had already attempted to make arrests in the city, but they were not successful. Activists have been spreading the word to migrants to not open their doors if an immigration agent knocks, since they cannot use force to enter a residence. In Chicago, another city where raids were expected, streets in immigrant communities were quieter than on an ordinary Sunday. Mayor Lori Lightfoot addressed residents on the North Side of Chicago before the raids were expected to start. \"This is a community that has a diversity of people coming from all over the world. There's been a lot of rumors,\" Lightfoot said. \"Dangling this sword over people's head is causing great harm and trauma to entire households, entire communities.\" The weekend operation was reportedly supposed to focus on immigrant families who have been sent final orders of removal after failing to appear in court. And top administration officials have argued that many of the estimated 2,000 migrants who fit this category have ignored requests to turn themselves in. President Trump originally set the nationwide raids for June, before delaying the planned mass arrests to give Congress more time to hammer out changes to federal asylum law. The American Civil Liberties Union, representing four immigration legal aid nonprofit groups, sued Thursday to block the raids, arguing that while the Trump administration claims the migrants have been given an opportunity to appear in court, many never received the paperwork because letters were sent to wrong addresses, or when they did arrive, the requests to appear did not contain specific dates and times. And so, the lawsuit claimed, the families that were expected to be targeted have never received proper notice of removal and did not have their day in court before an immigration judge. \"Unless this Court enforces that requirement, thousands of individuals could be deported without ever receiving a fair opportunity to appear before a judge, as required by the Due Process Clause and the immigration laws,\" lawyer Melinda LeMoine wrote in the suit, which is pending a judge's ruling.

A new Trump administration rule says immigrants who pass through a third country en route to the U.S. cannot apply for asylum at the U.S. southern border. Gregory Bull/AP hide caption A migrant family waits in Tijuana, Mexico, before being transported to the San Ysidro port of entry to begin the process of applying for asylum in the United States. A new Trump administration rule says immigrants who pass through a third country en route to the U.S. cannot apply for asylum at the U.S. southern border. Updated at 3:35 p.m. ET The Trump administration is moving forward with a tough new asylum rule in its campaign to slow the flow of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Asylum-seeking immigrants who pass through a third country en route to the U.S. must first apply for refugee status in that country rather than at the U.S. border. The restriction will likely face court challenges, opening a new front in the battle over U.S. immigration policies. The interim final rule will take effect immediately after it is published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, according to the departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The new policy applies specifically to the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that \"an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border after failing to apply for protection in a third country outside the alien's country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which the alien transited en route to the United States is ineligible for asylum.\" \"Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull' factor driving irregular migration to the United States,\" Homeland Security acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan said in a statement about the new rule. The American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to file a lawsuit to try to stop the rule from taking effect. \"This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly,\" Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's national Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement. Gelernt accused the Trump administration of \"trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger.\" The strict policy shift would likely bring new pressures and official burdens on Mexico and Guatemala, countries through which migrants and refugees often pass on their way to the U.S. On Sunday, Guatemala's government pulled out of a meeting between President Jimmy Morales and Trump that had been scheduled for Monday, citing ongoing legal questions over whether the country could be deemed a \"safe third country\" for migrants who want to reach the U.S. Hours after the U.S. announced the rule on Monday, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said it was a unilateral move that will not affect Mexican citizens. \"Mexico does not agree with measures that limit asylum and refugee status for those who fear for their lives or safety, and who fear persecution in their country of origin,\" Ebrard said. Ebrard said Mexico will maintain its current policies, reiterating the country's \"respect for the human rights of all people, as well as for its international commitments in matters of asylum and political refuge.\" According to a DHS news release, the U.S. rule would set \"a new bar to eligibility\" for anyone seeking asylum. It also allows exceptions in three limited cases: \"1) an alien who demonstrates that he or she applied for protection from persecution or torture in at least one of the countries through which the alien transited en route to the United States, and the alien received a final judgment denying the alien protection in such country; \"(2) an alien who demonstrates that he or she satisfies the definition of 'victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons' provided in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.11; or, \"(3) an alien who has transited en route to the United States through only a country or countries that were not parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol, or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\" The DHS release describes asylum as \" a discretionary benefit offered by the United States Government to those fleeing persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" The departments of Justice and Homeland Security are publishing the 58-page asylum rule as the Trump administration faces criticism over conditions at migrant detention centers at the southern border, as well as its \"remain in Mexico\" policy that requires asylum-seekers who are waiting for a U.S. court date to do so in Mexico rather than in the U.S. In a statement about the new rule, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said that current U.S. asylum rules have been abused, and that the large number of people trying to enter the country has put a strain on the system. Barr said the number of cases referred to the Department of Justice for proceedings before an immigration judge \"has risen exponentially, more than tripling between 2013 and 2018.\" The attorney general added, \"Only a small minority of these individuals, however, are ultimately granted asylum.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Nina Totenberg Chief Justice John Roberts is positioning the Supreme Court in a way that has both conservatives and liberals complaining and wondering what exactly Roberts is trying to do. Jabin Botsford/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Chief Justice John Roberts is positioning the Supreme Court in a way that has both conservatives and liberals complaining and wondering what exactly Roberts is trying to do. What was he thinking? That is the question many are asking on both sides of the political spectrum. Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly voted with the Supreme Court's conservatives this term, except in one, and only one, 5-4 decision. Written by Roberts, the ruling blocked the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, leaving an angry President Trump desperately trying to find a way around it. It also left a lot of speculation about the motives of the chief justice. He often does appear like he's very focused on his legacy and on being popular rather than on doing what a judge should do. Curt Levey, the conservative Committee for Justice For some conservatives, Roberts' vote in the census case was another original sin, much like his vote in 2012 to uphold key provisions of Obamacare. The chairman of the American Conservative Union has even called for Roberts' impeachment. \"I'm for impeaching the Chief Justice for lying to all of us about his support of the Constitution,\" tweeted ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp. \"He's responsible for Robertscare and now he is angling for vast numbers of illegal residents to help Dems hold Congress.\" I\u2019m for impeaching the Chief Justice for lying to all of us about his support of the Constitution. He is responsible for Robertscare and now he is angling for vast numbers of illegal residents to help Dems hold Congress. Enough Deception from GOP judges on the Constitution. Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, doesn't go that far, but he said the census decision means that \"having a conservative majority on the court is still a dream rather than a reality.\" Yet even Levey concedes that Roberts has been a reliable conservative vote on the court. Indeed, Roberts racked up an 80% rate of agreement with the court's other conservatives in all opinions, the same percentage as the court's most conservative justice, Clarence Thomas. As for liberal, and moderate, advocates and activists, they were not exactly out there speaking about the chief justice in glowing terms. While relieved that the census looked \u2014 for now \u2014 immune to political machinations, they were infuriated by another, and perhaps even more important, Roberts opinion. Traitor or agenda-driven conservative? Writing for himself and the court's four other conservatives, the chief justice slammed the door shut on court challenges to extreme partisan gerrymanders. The decision will allow many state legislatures unfettered discretion to draw congressional and state legislative district lines so as to entrench their own political power. Because Republicans now control state legislatures in 30 states, versus 18 controlled by Democrats, the decision is a boon to GOP power. (There are 22 states completely controlled by Republicans, and 14 where Democrats have total control). It isn't just liberals who have pushed for some court supervision of extreme partisan gerrymandering in an era of computer-driven hyper-partisanship. \"There's no doubt there's an agenda here,\" said Harvard Law professor Charles Fried, who served for four years in the Reagan administration as solicitor general, the government's chief advocate in the Supreme Court. He and other Republican former officeholders filed a brief on behalf of those challenging extreme partisan gerrymanders. Alluding to Roberts' famous confirmation hearing comment that the job of a judge is not to bat for one side but to \"call balls and strikes,\" Fried observes caustically, \"This is not balls and strikes. This is a long term, shrewdly played, but persistent program.\" The agenda \"is to get the law, whether it's the courts, or the Constitution, or the legislators\" out of regulating \"anything to do with elections.\" Fried catalogs Roberts' decisions in this regard. He wrote the court's 5-4 decision striking down the Voting Rights Act, a law passed and reenacted repeatedly by large and bipartisan congressional majorities. He wrote or participated in a series of decisions striking down longstanding, as well as newer, limits on campaign contributions, also enacted by Congress, and aimed at limiting the role of big money in politics. And when the court, by a 5-4 vote, upheld independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda, Roberts wrote the dissent. The decisive fifth vote in that case was Justice Anthony Kennedy, now retired, and Fried worries that the 2015 decision is now in peril, even though Roberts, in the gerrymandering decision, pointed to the commissions as \"one way\" to take redistricting out of the hands incumbents. While Fried and others fret about what they see as Roberts' deviousness, Roberts' conservative critics are not the least bit appeased. They view him as something of a traitor, mainly for the Obamacare and census decisions. Levey, of the Committee for Justice, sees Roberts as a man more concerned with his image than the law. \"He often does appear like he's very focused on his legacy and on being popular rather than on doing what a judge should do,\" Levey said, adding that \"all the pressure from the mainstream media and the establishment is to move left.\" Motivated by a \"Solomonic dogma\"? Others, like Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, have a different view. Though Roberts has been dubbed \"the new swing justice,\" in the wake of Kennedy's retirement last year, Blackman thinks that is a misnomer. He sees Kennedy and retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as \"actually somewhere in the middle,\" whereas \"Roberts is a solid conservative, but for whatever reason, in certain high-profile cases, he takes these very bizarre paths that no one else in the court goes along with.\" It is true that nobody on the court went along with all of Roberts' reasoning in either the census case or the the Obamacare case. \"I think Roberts is motivated by some sort of Solomonic dogma, that in any given case of high note,\" Blackman said, \"that the correct decision is one where he splits the proverbial baby.\" Of course, chief justices \u2014 Republican and Democratic, liberal and conservative alike \u2014 have uniformly believed that they have a particular duty to maintain public confidence in the court as an institution. For instance, in 2000, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, wrote the opinion upholding a decision he had long reviled, the decision that 34 years earlier required police to warn criminal suspects of their rights. And, in the 1930s Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes worked hard behind the scenes, on and off the court, to prevent President Franklin Roosevelt's court-packing plan from becoming law. Some historians believe that he was even instrumental in persuading one justice to moderate his views to defuse the threat. Today, Roberts faces similar threats: a president who openly and repeatedly castigates judges in partisan and even ethnic terms, and Democratic presidential contenders, who think the number of justices on the Supreme Court should be expanded by statute if the Democrats take control of the Senate. They argue that Republicans, by refusing for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, have so stacked the deck that the move is necessary. As some who know Roberts observe, while this and other such proposals are still in their relative infancy, the chief justice cannot ignore the alarm bells. And he knows that if the court moves too far to the right and too fast, those bells will only ring louder.

Adam Bettcher/Getty Images hide caption President Trump speaks at a roundtable on the economy and tax reform in April. Heading into the 2020 campaign, Democratic candidates are trying to find arguments against him on the economy, which is doing well according to top-line indicators. At the Democratic presidential debate this week, voters got a preview of how Democrats will handle what for now is an uphill battle against President Trump. That challenging hill is the economy, because it's doing well right now, at least by the headline numbers. Unemployment is at 3.6 percent, the lowest it's been in about 50 years, and growth is still moving at a good clip. Consumer confidence is generally high (despite a recent slip). On top of that, one key point: despite Trump's approval rating being stuck in the mid-40s, he tends to do better on the economy. All that could make Trump's path to another term much easier. So Democrats are trying to thread a tricky needle: telling voters that while the economy is doing well, it is doing disproportionately well for the rich. In other words: the current good economy should be benefiting all of you more. The economy is doing okay... so what to improve? There's evidence that the economy particularly bears on voters' choices. Yale economist Ray Fair has a relatively well-known model for predicting the popular vote based on economic indicators. His latest prediction, as of April: that the Democratic nominee will get 45 percent of the popular vote. All of which is to say that if the economy is still doing well next year, Democrats may have to figure out how to tell people how things could be even better. That's where the \"the economy isn't working for everyone\" idea comes in. It's an idea that got a lot of play during the two debates. It's of course been at the core of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' stump speech for years. It's a huge part of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign message, which she brought out on Wednesday night: \"I think of it this way: Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the economy under President Trump is \"doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top\" at this week's Democratic primary debate. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the economy under President Trump is \"doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top\" at this week's Democratic primary debate. California Sen. Kamala Harris echoed this sentiment: \"This president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not.\" And that's just two candidates. A range of others this week \u2014 Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, to name several \u2014 made similar arguments. One challenge they face is connecting with voters on this idea \u2014 that the economy is fundamentally broken and in need of structural change. One political problem with that argument is that it doesn't have a distinct villain \u2014 just the \"1 percent\" of richest Americans or corporations. Thus far, the candidates seem to have found two ways to address that problem, and one is the Trump tax cuts. Harris took aim at these at the debate, stressing that the Republican tax bill \"benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in America.\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sanders likewise made similar arguments. It's a line of attack that seizes on a concrete policy that \u2014 at least, as of tax day 2019 \u2014 was broadly unpopular. So it's easy to see this being a key line of attack for a Democratic nominee in 2020. Once again, though, it's easy to see how the argument that the rich are doing too well might not move voters who themselves feel more or less fine about the economy. Another line of attack Democrats took in the debates was to connect the economy to particular topic areas, like health care. When it comes to their personal finances, Americans list health care costs as their top concern, according to Gallup. It's perhaps no coincidence, then, that multiple times, when candidates brought up the economy, they tied it to that issue. Especially given that health care was key to Democratic victories in 2018, this could be a particularly attractive tactic for a Democratic nominee. Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California both argued that the economy is not working well for average Americans on stage Thursday at the Democratic presidential debate. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California both argued that the economy is not working well for average Americans on stage Thursday at the Democratic presidential debate. The potential hurdles for Trump Whether or not it affects people's votes, candidates aren't wrong when they say Americans are not sharing equally in a strong economy. One 2017 study showed what many Americans might already intuit: that economic growth just doesn't benefit lower and middle-class Americans the way it used to. Another way to get at this: The labor share of GDP \u2014 the share of economic output that goes to workers in their paychecks (or benefits) \u2014 has fallen precipitously in recent decades. So Democrats have good data they can point to. If a nominee can somehow connect to voters on an emotional level on that idea, it's possible they could win some over. In addition, despite a generally strong economy, Trump faces a couple of other challenges: One is that his approval (as we said earlier) is still pretty low \u2014 and he has only experienced a good economy as president. He could take a hit if the economy tanks. And the economy very well could turn bad before Election Day 2020. A recent survey from a panel of business economists found a jump in recession fears for 2020 \u2014 right now, those economists say there's a 60 percent chance of a recession by the end of next year. In the next year and a half, then, a Democratic message on the economy could change dramatically. But for now, Democrats must wrestle with the tough question of how to sell a new economic message when things look relatively okay.

        "texts": "AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Democratic presidential candidates have already been out on the trail for months pushing their policies as well as their broader visions for what they want America to look like, including Senator Elizabeth Warren. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe that the time for small ideas is over. We need big structural change in this country and this economy. CORNISH: Tonight Warren and nine other presidential contenders will have to explain their ideas to change the country. It will be the first time many Americans get a real introduction to these candidates and their policies. Now for more on what we might hear, we have NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben. Welcome to the studio. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: You've actually been looking at all of these plans and proposals, which is no small thing 'cause we're talking about a lot of people. KURTZLEBEN: Right, yeah. CORNISH: What's the biggest question you have heading into tonight's debate? KURTZLEBEN: I have big questions about how specific candidates get, especially on the topic of health care because that's an area where they are being very sweeping in some cases. Let's talk Elizabeth Warren, for example. She will be on the stage tonight. She'll be center stage. And she is the I-have-a-plan person in this race. That is her slogan or one of her slogans. And she has co-sponsored \"Medicare for All.\" That's Senator Bernie Sanders' plan to get single-payer health care. It would create a government-run insurance program and virtually eliminate private insurance. But she's not alone in cosponsoring it, but she and various other co-sponsors have been - they have not necessarily said, yes, Medicare for All right away. They have said there are different paths. That's one of Elizabeth Warren's lines. There are different ways to get there. So one thing I'm curious about pinning these people down on is, OK, what is the path? What do you think is the best way to get to that - what could be a very, very big change to a huge sector of the U.S. economy? Moreover, she'll be on stage tonight with more moderate candidates like Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Amy Klobuchar backs a public option that would allow people to buy into Medicaid. So I'm curious to see what kind of differences there are on the stage and how much candidates might go after each other on that. CORNISH: Right. After the 2018 midterms, Democrats really said, look; health care is our issue. KURTZLEBEN: Very much. CORNISH: But are you getting that sense from voters? KURTZLEBEN: Voters - yeah, I mean, voters do care about health care very much, but they don't just care about, hey, big systemic change - what is it going to look like? They care about a lot of specific things like prescription drug prices, the opioid epidemic, reproductive rights, things that fall under a broad health care umbrella. So some of these problems are really hard to solve - is the issue. And it's hard for a candidate to even get at them in a full campaign speech, let alone the 60-second responses they're going to have tonight. So that could be really difficult to get at. Aside from that, climate change is something else, by the way, that candidates are really going to try to pin down tonight. CORNISH: During the last presidential election, we did hear about student debt on the Democratic side, and it looks like we're hearing about it again. How do the candidates differ on the issue? KURTZLEBEN: Right. You have a really broad range. Now, the candidates all seem to agree that, yes, there is something systemically wrong with the way that people pay for college in America but big differences in how to get there. Bernie Sanders this week put out a plan to eliminate all student debt - $1.6 trillion worth. That is a huge, huge sweeping plan. Two people who will be on the stage tonight, Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro - they both have less-sweeping plans to eliminate student debt. But there are other people with other routes to it. Cory Booker, New Jersey senator - he'll be on stage. He has signed on to what's called the Debt-Free College Act, which is just what it sounds like. It's a way to get people to graduate college debt-free. Kamala Harris has signed on as well. And you have people with more moderate plans - once again, Amy Klobuchar. So once again - lots of agreement that something needs to be done on a lot of topics tonight but not necessarily agreement on how to fix those big problems. CORNISH: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben on the big policy discussions were likely to hear at tonight's first Democratic presidential debate. Thanks so much. KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

From left: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. If the overarching question heading into the first debate of the 2020 presidential primary for Democratic voters was \"Who can you see as president up there?\" it's not certain they got a clear answer. Rather than fireworks \u2014 toward each other or President Trump \u2014 the candidates took a cautious approach. Will that be the approach on Night 2, Thursday night, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden on the same stage? Credit: NPR Here are five takeaways from Wednesday night's debate: 1. Elizabeth Warren was consistent. Of all the candidates, the Massachusetts senator came in as the biggest star and, because of that, probably had the most pressure on her. But she was consistent, sticking to policy and her vision for the United States. The impression she made with her answer to the first question set the tone. She was asked a fastball down the middle about whether her succession of big policy proposals would be too much change for the country, and she went to her bread-and-butter response: that a \"thinner and thinner slice\" of the country is getting ahead and that this needs to change. That's a home run for what she's trying to do with her candidacy. We will see, though, if going out on the plank to say that she supports eliminating private health insurance comes back to haunt her if she gets the nomination. It was remarkable that she and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio were the only ones to raise their hands to say they did. 2. The gloves stayed on \u2014 and the shape of the race stays the same. The moderators tried with the first two questions to stir up a fight between the progressive and pragmatic wings of the Democratic Party, calling on Warren and then shifting to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on whether the field was going too far. But Klobuchar didn't take the bait. \"I had to sit back and say, 'This is the first debate,' \" Klobuchar said afterward on MSNBC, pointing out that she would have liked to have talked more about Russia and farm policy. That meant the shape of the race did not change. It's a reminder that it's early, and until the lines become more sharply defined, the candidates may hold back, although the dynamics for Thursday night's debate may be different. 3. They didn't take the fight to Trump. It is remarkable that the candidates had relatively little to say about President Trump. It was almost as if he didn't exist \u2014 and the candidates cared more about Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. But Trump is running for reelection \u2014 and reelection campaigns almost always come down to referendums on sitting presidents and their policies. None of the candidates really made the case as to why they are best equipped to take the fight to Trump. That's especially glaring given that Democratic voters are saying that what matters most to them is electability and that what they want more than anything is to beat Trump. Even Trump was unperturbed by the debate, dismissing it as boring, and he reserved his biggest criticism for NBC's technical difficulties. BORING! .@NBCNews and @MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate. Truly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are! 4. Beto O'Rourke did not help his cause. Warren needed to be consistent, and she was. Klobuchar is still in the conversation and had a couple of good moments. But former Rep. Beto O'Rourke shared the middle of the stage with Warren; he needed a good debate, but struggled at times. He often looked overshadowed, and his lack of policy specifics was glaring, especially standing next to Warren. It was that way right from the start when the moderator asked him whether he supports a marginal tax rate of 70% on high-income earners making $10 million a year or more. He deflected and started speaking in Spanish three sentences later. Later, O'Rourke had a hard time defending himself on immigration policy against his fellow Texan, Juli\u00e1n Castro, who had a strong debate, speaking for marginalized people and communities. It's always especially damning when a candidate plays into a narrative of them that's already out there \u2014 and for O'Rourke, that rap is that he's light on policy specifics. 5. Tonight's another night. The first Democrat presidential debate continues Thursday night and will include Biden, Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Will Trump be more of a factor? Do the gloves come off against Biden? Does Harris break out finally? Is Buttigieg able to handle the scrutiny after the police shooting in South Bend that sidelined him from the campaign? Will foreign policy be more of an issue for this group of candidates? Will there be any surprising moments? If Democrats watching at home weren't thrilled with their choices onstage Wednesday night, they'll have another crop of 10 to pick from Thursday.

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have escalated recently following Iran's shootdown of a U.S. drone and U.S. cyberattacks against an Iranian intelligence group. On Monday, President Trump announced financial sanctions against Khamenei and other top officials. Updated Tuesday at 8:40 a.m. ET Tensions continue to rise between the United States and Iran following last week's sharp escalation in which Tehran downed a U.S. drone and the U.S. conducted cyberattacks against an Iranian intelligence group. On Monday, President Trump announced financial sanctions against Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and several other top officials. The supreme leader later said it marked \"the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,\" while Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the move \"outrageous and idiotic.\" Earlier in the day, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reportedly told his country's lawmakers that Iran will continue to stand firm against U.S. sanctions and threats \"with full power.\" An Iranian navy chief also warned that the country would shoot down more of America's surveillance drones if they violated Iran's airspace. The escalation of tensions comes more than a year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reapplied heavy economic and diplomatic pressure against the country. The administration says the \"maximum pressure\" campaign is designed to draw Iran back to negotiate a new, tougher deal, which Iran has so far rejected. Here is a look at the tense standoff from Iran's standpoint. Why did Iran shoot down a U.S. drone? Last Thursday, Iranian forces shot down a U.S. unmanned aircraft with a surface-to-air missile over the Strait of Hormuz, a stretch of water between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Iran claimed the drone had entered Iranian airspace. Washington denied that and released images that U.S. officials said showed the drone's flight path appearing to be in international waters close to Iran. Iranian officials then held a news conference and displayed what they said were pieces of drone wreckage collected in Iran's territorial waters. The shootdown was the most dramatic moment in the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran. Trump said the military was about to strike Iranian targets on Thursday in retaliation for the drone shootdown but he called off the strike. \"The downing of the U.S. drone had an explicit, decisive and clear message that defenders of the Islamic Iran's borders will show decisive and knockout reactions to aggression against this territory by any alien,\" Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, a commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, said hours after the shootdown, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. What does Iran want out of all this? The world's seventh-largest oil producer last year, Iran wants to be able to sell its oil freely, without the pressure of U.S. sanctions cutting off many of its usual markets. Countries such as Russia and China have continued their trade with Iran. But the Trump administration says its goal is to \"bring Iran's oil exports to zero,\" something Tehran has vowed will never happen. Under the sanctions, European buyers and others struggle to find a way to protect companies that may want to continue doing business with Tehran without being penalized by the U.S. and losing access to the lucrative U.S. market. Ultimately, Iran wants to be treated as a major Middle Eastern power whose interests must be respected. The Trump administration says that for Tehran to enjoy normalized relations, it has to meet a dozen demands, including stopping support for militias in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and the Palestinian territories, as well as halting uranium enrichment and ballistic missile systems. Iran has rejected these terms. What are the divisions in Iran? Iranian politics are marked by divisions \u2014 most notably between moderates and hard-liners. President Hassan Rouhani, whose administration negotiated the nuclear deal with the U.S., European countries and other world powers, is sometimes considered a moderate in comparison with Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. But in fact Rouhani is no moderate. Another term often used to describe him \u2014 \"pragmatist\" \u2014 might be more accurate. Rouhani is a confirmed supporter of the Islamic Revolution that brought Iran's cleric-led government to power in 1979. The main difference between Rouhani and the hard-liners is Rouhani's willingness to engage with the outside world to achieve Iran's goals. During the Obama administration, with the prospect of sanctions relief in sight, even Khamenei gave grudging support to the nuclear negotiations. But after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal, Khamenei declared that Iran should never negotiate with America, because its word can't be trusted. What are Iran's options? Iran's Revolutionary Guard has the capacity to act, though Tehran denies Washington's assertion that the Revolutionary Guard was behind recent attacks on cargo ships in the Persian Gulf. In April, the State Department designated the Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist organization. Iran has proxy allies in the region, such as the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and militias in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. Tehran has threatened to retaliate against any action against it by the U.S. or its allies in the region. After the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal in May 2018, Iran could also pull out of it, something the remaining signatories \u2014 which include European countries, Russia and China \u2014 want to avoid. Then there is Trump's stated desire for talks with Iran. U.S. officials say they believe sufficient pressure will bring Iran back to the table. But so far, Iran's supreme leader has refused new talks with the U.S., and Iranian government officials also say they will not negotiate under the current conditions. In an interview with NPR last week, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht Ravanchi, said, \"You cannot negotiate with somebody who has a knife in his hand putting the knife under your throat.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation, but even some Democrats who co-sponsored it have welcomed other policies. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images hide caption Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand are among the presidential candidates to back Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation, but even some Democrats who co-sponsored it have welcomed other policies. On Wednesday and Thursday, 20 candidates will take the Democratic debate stage to talk about a wide range of policy topics. And 20 candidates times dozens of policies equals a lot to keep track of. It's true that, these being Democratic candidates, there's a lot they all agree on \u2014 taking action on climate change, for example, or improving the health care system. But this debate is the first time we'll see them next to each other, coming into direct conflict over what, exactly, they disagree on. With all that in mind, what follows is a primer on the main policy questions we'll be watching for at the first Democratic debates. 1) Health care: What, specifically, do the candidates want? Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" plan has played a huge role in setting the terms of the health care conversation. That plan is a single-payer plan, meaning it would create a government-run insurance program financed by taxpayers. Four of Sanders' Democratic opponents have signed on as \"Medicare-for-all\" co-sponsors in the Senate, and three have co-sponsored a House single-payer bill. But that doesn't mean they've all landed firmly on Sanders' plan as the best option. California Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, has waffled on whether she would be in favor of eliminating private insurance \u2014 and \"Medicare-for-all\" would virtually eliminate private insurance. One reason this matters: Polls show that many voters don't entirely understand \"Medicare-for-all.\" When they do find that out, polling has shown, support tends to drop. So one important question is whether candidates would be OK with that kind of dramatic step. And if not, what sort of plan do they want? Some candidates, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are open to \"Medicare-for-all\" as well as other options. Others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have said a public option in addition to private insurance is best for now. Pinning all the candidates down on exactly how big of a change they want to make will be a huge question. 2) Climate change: How much daylight between candidates? After being a lower-tier issue for years among Democrats, climate change has taken center stage. And a lot like \"Medicare-for-all\" in the health care debate, the sweeping Green New Deal has set the terms of the climate discussion. Except the Green New Deal isn't a policy \u2014 it's more of a broad framework that sets out big goals. So a thing to listen for at the debates is how specific candidates get \u2014 and, in the process, how much they end up differing from each other \u2014 on what, exactly, to do about climate change. How much federal money would they spend? What role could nuclear energy play? Is a carbon tax part of the plan? 3) Immigration: How far will they go beyond criticizing Trump? The Trump administration's family separation policy, as well as the conditions in facilities holding migrant children, have angered many Americans \u2014 Democrats especially. So when immigration comes up at the debates, you can expect candidates to castigate the Trump administration for these policies. But the question is what else they suggest doing beyond reversing President Trump's policies. What might a path to citizenship look like? Do they plan to amp up personnel to deal with the backlog of immigration and asylum cases? Do they want to expand border security or border barriers? In addition, many people coming to the United States illegally are fleeing some sort of terrible circumstances in their home countries \u2014 economic ruin, for example, or gang violence. So what would any of these prospective presidents want to do to try to change those conditions abroad, particularly in Central America? 4) Trade: Will Democrats' big rifts expose themselves? Trade is an area where there's room for Democratic candidates to really differ. As vice president, Joe Biden \u2014 along with plenty of Democrats \u2014 pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive deal meant to open up Asian markets and attempt to set the rules for China. But this created a big rift within the left, as figures like Sanders and Warren were staunchly opposed to the deal, saying it was bad for American workers. Hillary Clinton eventually came out against it in her 2016 primary run against Sanders. And that message \u2014 that trade hurts American workers \u2014 is one that President Trump ran heavily on in 2016. In fact, Sanders and Warren both applauded Trump's exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So when trade deals come up, they have the potential to open a clear divide in the pool of Democratic candidates. As with immigration, it could be easy for Democrats to simply blast Trump's actions. But if the debates dig into what they would actually want to do once in office \u2014 Try to get into more multilateral deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Repeal all of Trump's tariffs? \u2014 it could lead to some genuine disagreements on the stage. 5) Foreign policy: Which fires to put out and in what order? All these candidates are auditioning to be commander in chief at a time of growing international tensions \u2014 most notably, the recent escalating tensions with Iran, almost culminating in U.S. strikes and eventually new sanctions. So these candidates could face some tough questions: How would the U.S. deal with Iran? Was it wrong for Trump to sit down with Kim Jong Un? How do you stop election interference by Russia and others? It's not just about enemies and frenemies either. Candidates must also consider how they would repair relationships with allies that Trump has strained, as well as how they might want to improve America's standing in the eyes of the world. 6) Race-conscious policies: How would you alleviate racial inequality? The topic of reparations has become a key economic policy issue in the 2020 campaign. Many of the Democratic presidential candidates support H.R. 40, a House resolution to create a commission to study reparations for African Americans. It's a policy that could prove divisive among voters; an April poll from Fox News found that just over half of Democrats approve of reparations, and that only one-third of Americans do. Beyond that, candidates take different tacks in how they would specifically work to benefit racial minorities. Some have explicitly race-based economic proposals, like Warren's plan to boost minority-owned small businesses. Other proposals, like Sen. Cory Booker's \"baby bonds\" proposal, are race blind but would stand to particularly boost black and Hispanic Americans. Criminal justice is another area where candidates have attempted to reduce inequality; Cory Booker's clemency plan, released last week, aims to lessen racial sentencing disparities. 7) Priorities: What will the candidates throw their weight behind? Each of these candidates has taken positions (or made vague pronouncements) on dozens of issues. But they can't do everything \u2014 overhauling health care, criminal justice, democratic procedures and tax policy in one term would be virtually impossible. So they'll have to prioritize. And one thing we're watching closely for is what candidates would tackle first. What issues are so important that they would spend their precious political capital on them right after inauguration?

        "texts": "Jessica Taylor Loading... President Trump will officially kick off his 2020 reelection campaign with a rally in Florida on Tuesday night. But in reality, he has been running for a second term ever since he took office. The former reality TV star and real estate mogul \u2014 the first president without prior political or military experience \u2014 used an unorthodox campaign style to notch an upset win in 2016, with massive rallies to excite supporters. And he's employed that same strategy, with a heavily blurred line between official duties and trying to sell his agenda muddled with outright politicking, since taking office. In fact, Trump filed his official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 20, 2017 \u2014 mere hours after he was inaugurated. And less than a month later, he would hold a rally (also in Florida) that was paid for by his campaign committee. When asked by a reporter if this was too early in his presidency to hold such an event, Trump replied, \"Life is a campaign.\" As president-elect, he also launched a \"victory tour\" of sorts to battleground states. So while the Trump campaign may bill this as the official start of the president's bid for a second term, it's truly anything but. Since 2017, Trump has held more than 60 rallies. Nearly three-quarters of those occurred during 2018, where he was often stumping for down-ballot candidates in the midterm elections. Loading... Perhaps more than any other president in recent history, Trump relished in such an extensive campaign travel schedule. And while it's certainly nothing new for commanders in chief to stump for members of their own party during the midterm elections, Trump's approach was very different. Ultimately, such rallies really felt more like a vehicle to promote Trump \u2014 with his own \"Make America Great Again\" branding, unwieldy bravado and raucous atmosphere, and usually a brief recognition of the candidate he was there to support. He also unveiled another \"Keep America Great\" slogan just more than a year into his first term. If tonight's rally is seen as Trump's true \"official\" launch, it's about on par timing-wise with when President Bill Clinton started angling for a second term. It was in late June of 1995 that Clinton held a fundraiser for his reelection coffers (Trump would do that for the first time back in June 2017, less than six months after his inauguration) alongside first lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper. The media billed it as his effective launch. But as The New York Times noted in a May 1996 story, there had long been a \"shadow campaign\" within the White House, trying to use the \"rhetorical, ceremonial and majestic possibilities of incumbency\" to help boost him, even \"forsak[ing] the traditional formal announcement of his candidacy.\" Clinton, a gifted orator, also thrived on the stump and in retail politics environments. He traveled extensively ahead of the 1994 midterms (which also saw the House of Representatives flip parties, along with the Senate) and was energized by political events. And like other presidents, including President Barack Obama, often official events to tout job announcements or policy rollouts would not-so-coincidently be held in swing states, with executive branch functions having something of a campaign feel. While Obama officially announced his bid for reelection in April 2011 with a video and a fundraising swing, he wouldn't hold official campaign rallies until May 2012, well after it was clear that Mitt Romney would be the GOP nominee. But Obama had long been holding official events in swing states that would serve as the foundation for his ultimately successful reelection bid, along with a massive digital infrastructure. President George W. Bush filed for reelection shortly after his first midterm elections. He wouldn't hold a rally to officially kick off his bid for a second term until March 2004, when it also was assumed that Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry would be the Democratic nominee. Bush also chose Florida for the site of that rally \u2014 the state that gave him enough electoral votes to win in 2000 after a protracted and controversial recount that ended with a decision from the Supreme Court. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both waited even later to formally transition into reelection mode. The elder Bush didn't even file for reelection until October 1991 and held his first official campaign fundraiser later that month. Reagan waited longer, not filing with the FEC until October 1983 and kicking off his run at a second term \u2014 which he had wavered on even seeking \u2014 until late January 1984, with a televised Oval Office address paid for by his campaign and a \"Spirit of America\" rally in Atlanta. Trump's campaign asserts tonight's Orlando rally will, indeed, be different from other campaign-style rallies that preceded it. This event comes almost exactly four years since he made his initial campaign launch, riding down the golden escalator of Trump Tower, as he often likes to reminisce about in speeches and at rallies. First lady Melania Trump, Vice President Pence and second lady Karen Pence will all be there, which is not typical of previous events. The Trump children will also be in attendance, though several of the president's kids, especially Don Jr., are often featured warmup speakers at Trump rallies. That full cast makes it seem like they're trying to give off more of a convention feel at the official kickoff rally, with the actual Republican National Convention scheduled for August 2020 in Charlotte, N.C. The location of this rally isn't by accident, either. This will be Trump's seventh rally in Florida since taking office \u2014 the most of any state. The site of his first post-campaign stop on Feb. 18, 2017, was Melbourne, and he held a rally just last month in Panama City. He also visited the state four times in the run-up to the 2018 midterms, where two close allies, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, won their Senate and gubernatorial races, respectively, in very close elections \u2014 one of the few bright spots for Republicans amid a mostly bruising midterm cycle. Of course, Trump desperately needs to keep Florida's 29 electoral votes in his column come 2020, after eking out a win of just over 1 percentage point in 2016. The state he's stumped in second-most is Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral votes he will also need to keep in his column to win reelection. Losing both those states combined would virtually guarantee a loss. Even before the midterms push began, though, Trump was holding rallies in deep red areas, such as Kentucky and Tennessee. Unlike his 2016 bid, Trump's reelection efforts are more professionalized and organized, so more of a focus on simply swing areas he has to win or keep in his column would be expected. But if Trump has already been campaigning his entire first term for a second one, don't expect him to slow down over the coming months, especially as he's eager to shift attention away from the Democratic field and onto himself. \"When the rally schedule picks up, it will be unmistakable,\" a Trump campaign official said.

Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images hide caption Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during a television interview after the second night of the first Democratic presidential debates in Miami. When Sen. Kamala Harris of California launched her presidential campaign in January and drew a crowd of 20,000 in Oakland, Calif., she raised some eyebrows about the potential for her candidacy. But during the early stretch of this Democratic primary campaign, Harris struggled to catch on or stand apart \u2014 until Thursday night. Harris showed in the second night of the first Democratic presidential primary debate why so many thought she had such promise as a candidate from the beginning. She commanded the stage, was crisp, and showed skill and courage in going after former Vice President Joe Biden. Credit: Michael Zamora/NPR Here are five takeaways from the second night of debates: 1. Harris needed a breakout moment, and she got it Harris had more than one good moment during Thursday night's debate. In a debate where the candidates were much more willing to engage than they were on Wednesday night, Harris interjected early on and grabbed the spotlight. As several candidates talked over each other, she said, \"America does not want to witness a food fight; they want to know how we are going to put food on their table.\" Then she was impassioned, direct and specific when talking about immigration and what she would do in her early days as president to deal with the issue. But the key exchange of the debate was when she took on Biden over race. He had been on the defensive coming into the debate for his comments at a fundraiser about how he worked with people in the Senate, even segregationists with whom he disagreed. Harris said she has respect for Biden and did not believe Biden is a racist, but was clear and direct about how she felt he handled it and then invoked her own childhood of having been bused as part of school integration. And Biden didn't seem to know which direction to go with the line of attack. He got out of it by saying, \"Anyway, my time's up.\" 2. Biden did not have a good night Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stand next to each other during the second night of Democratic presidential debates. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stand next to each other during the second night of Democratic presidential debates. On everything from defending his comments about those segregationist senators to his Iraq War vote to what would be the first things he would do as president (defeat Donald Trump), Biden looked out of touch with the Democratic Party of 2019. What's worse, though, is what a debate like this could do to the premise of his candidacy \u2014 that he's the strongest candidate to take on President Trump. That's what's been holding Biden up in the polls, and he can't afford to have his electability bubble pierced and look like a risky choice to put on stage against Trump. Biden has a reservoir of support and good feelings within the party, so he can't be written off after one night, but his best hope might be that lots of people aren't tuned in yet and were watching something else \u2014 or went to bed early. 3. Sanders and Buttigieg were flat Sanders was the one itching for the fight with Biden, but Harris stole his thunder. Sanders has been saying the same things for 40 years about the problems facing the country, and it sounded like it on Thursday night. What was remarkable was that, despite his usual fluidity with what he sees as systemic problems afflicting America, he couldn't muster up what his priorities would be to accomplish his \"revolution.\" Every president has had to prioritize. President Barack Obama had to try and shore up the economy with the Recovery Act after the Great Recession; then, to the consternation of immigration activists, he went for health care. Those are the real, practical choices a president has to make as a legislative strategy, and Sanders simply criticized the moderator for being reductive. Pete Buttigieg struggled to command the stage in what was his biggest opportunity to speak to his widest audience yet about his message of generational change. But the racially polarizing police shooting in South Bend, Ind., where he is mayor, has consumed his campaign in the past couple of weeks. For his part, Buttigieg was ready for the questions about why black representation on his police force has not improved during his tenure (\"Because I couldn't get it done\"). He fell on his sword in a show of humility rarely seen in politics, but how that will play with voters is unclear. Some will undoubtedly like and respect it; others might see it as weakness, especially facing a candidate in Trump who apologizes for nothing. 4. The candidates showed themselves to be very liberal Democrats, living under Trump, are mad as hell, and they are frustrated. The past few presidential elections have had even more extreme pendulum swings than the last \u2014 George W. Bush resulted in Barack Obama, who was followed by Trump. So it might make sense then that Democrats are proposing policies that are very liberal and make them feel good. Here's some of what they are proposing (with who said they support them), based on two nights of debates: The problem is some of this is not very popular. Medicare for All is popular as a slogan, for example, but eliminating private health insurance is not. Some 6 in 10 people are against it, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (*Harris told NBC after the debate that she misunderstood that question, and that she was saying she would abolish her own private insurance plan \u2014 not everyone else's.) Part of this more liberal shift within the party is a reaction to Trump. And part of it is because the party has gotten more liberal. In 2003, during the Bush administration, two-thirds of Democrats considered themselves \"moderate\" or \"conservative.\" Today, that's only about half, while the number of Democrats considering themselves \"liberal\" has gone up from 29% to 46% in the past 16 years. The priorities of voters who align with the parties have changed over the last two decades \u2014 and moved farther apart. 5. The race was reshaped after a two-day debate If it was clear going into Wednesday and Thursday's extended debate that Biden and Sanders were the clear leaders in the field, that is simply not the case now. Instead, Harris and Warren proved their mettle. What was clear, perhaps, is that while there are a lot of candidates, there are really only about half a dozen who have stood out. Biden and Sanders will still be in the mix, as are Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was one lower-tier candidate who was able to vault himself into the conversation. Meanwhile, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Biden may have hurt themselves most of all the leading candidates. One thing is clear \u2014 there is a generational battle going on within the Democratic Party, and a lot of it centers on views of race and identity in a campaign that has the most diverse field in the history of presidential campaigns. That's especially prominent in the age of Trump and stands in stark contrast to the way he has campaigned and governed.

While he dismisses them as fake news, there may be a lesson to glean from historical presidential polling. As President Trump attends the G-20 summit in Japan this week, a score of Democrats who want his job are debating in Miami \u2014 vying for a nomination that looks increasingly worth having. Major polls taken in the late spring showed President Trump trailing his top Democratic challengers both nationwide and in key states where the 2020 election will be decided. One recent Fox News poll, for example, showed Trump trailing prospective challengers Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders by 10 and 9 percentage points, respectively. Weak polling numbers are not a new thing in the Trump presidency. In 2016, polls showed candidate Trump losing right up until the day he was elected. (Cliffhanger wins in several swing states produced his Electoral College majority, even as he lost the national popular vote by nearly 2 percentage points.) The president has long since made a habit of dismissing polls, or at least those he doesn't like, as one more example of \"fake news.\" Only Fake Polls show us behind the Motley Crew. We are looking really good, but it is far too early to be focused on that. Much work to do! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Yet it was widely reported this month that the president's own polling team had found similar results in its field work in March. When word of this leaked, and was confirmed by the president's campaign, the president reportedly fired three veteran members of his polling team. The president's campaign manager has said Trump's numbers have recovered since March and that his \"numbers have never been better,\" although he has yet to release any numbers to back up that assertion. Presidential perspective Poor poll numbers are not unusual for presidents midway through a first term. Three of the past four presidents who won a second term were trailing prospective opponents 18 months before they were reelected. As NPR's Mara Liasson has noted on Twitter, incumbents who have come back from significant deficits include Ronald Reagan, who won in 49 states against Walter Mondale in 1984. Moreover, the last incumbent president who lost his reelection bid (George H.W. Bush) did so after having been far ahead of the field with 18 months to go. check this out: -June 1983: Mondale 49%, Reagan 39%-June 1991: George H.W. Bush 51%, Democrat 28%, Don't know 21%-June 1995: Dole 48%, Clinton 44%-June 2011: Republican 44%, Obama 39% https://t.co/vqaXmtMm00 Polls pertain to a point in time, and their shelf life is short. They have only limited power to predict the future because the events and dynamics of the actual election year always alter the landscape in unforeseeable ways. So what is the value of a poll taken this far from Election Day? One answer might be found in the examples Liasson cited. All three of these presidents \u2014 Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 had suffered substantial setbacks in the midterm elections during their first term. Each was battling emboldened opponents in Congress. In June of the year preceding their reelection bids, three of the four were \"losing\" to either a specific opponent from the other party or a generic nominee of the other party. But all found ways to tack toward the center, accentuate the positive side of their first term and renew their personal bond with the voters who put them in office. All three wound up winning \u2014 Reagan in a historic landslide. Clinton and Obama were reelected more narrowly but still had comfortable leads in the Electoral College. So what happened to the one candidate Liasson cited who had been ahead at a comparable point in time? The first President Bush, flush with success after the quick collapse of the Iraqi army in the Persian Gulf War, seemed almost guaranteed a second term when polls were conducted in June 1991. Partly as a result, Bush and his team underestimated the challenges and challengers ahead. They were dismissive of intra-party rival Pat Buchanan and independent H. Ross Perot, and untroubled by such upstarts as Clinton, who was then the youthful governor of Arkansas. Worse yet, the Bush team would be slow to react to the recession that overtook the economy that fall. Battered by Buchanan and Perot and the economy in the early months of 1992, Bush found himself beleaguered and forced to cover his conservative flank. That led to moves such as his veto of the popular Family and Medical Leave Act (which was almost enacted over his veto). All this helped Clinton, who would win the three-way November election against Bush and Perot with just 43% of the popular vote. Led by the polls So, early polls cannot \"call the race.\" But they can point a candidacy in a particular direction, right or wrong. They can lead to complacency, or they can offer insight into the state of political opinion and the mix of national sentiments. Taken seriously, and taken in concert with other sources of intelligence, early polls can act as a corrective for a presidency at risk. We can read today's polls, then, and ask why Trump is not doing better in the midst of relative peace, low unemployment and interest rates, and a soaring stock market. We can also observe that he loses these hypothetical matchups despite overwhelming approval ratings among Republicans. Is there something he is doing that keeps his base firm but prevents its expansion? Are there ways the president can alter his approach and keep his friends close, while alienating fewer potential swing voters? So far, his reelection strategy seems centered on his base and the most provocative issues and behaviors that bind him to it. These include his hard line on immigration, tough talk on trade and bellicose attitude toward foreign adversaries \u2014 as well as his confrontational personal style. Defenders say \"it's worked for him so far,\" and that is true. But if the current polls mean anything, they mean that what has worked for him has limits. The signals are there to be seen.

        "texts": "Jessica Taylor Sex, Murder, and the Trial That Changed America by Chris Derose Hardcover, 353 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? There may be no two more addicting topics to people right now than politics and true crime. A Star Spangled Scandal delves into both of these \u2014 with a heavy dose of sex added in \u2014 to show not only how this obsession is certainly nothing new in American history, but also its long-lasting effects throughout the decades. Author Chris DeRose's book goes back more than a century and a half to detail what was essentially the first sensationalized murder trial in 1859 \u2014 one that became a footnote of history with widespread implications. Philip Barton Key, the son of revered \"Star Spangled Banner\" author Francis Scott Key, was the victim, dead at the hand of New York congressman Daniel Sickles, who had discovered the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was having an affair with his wife Teresa, a young Italian beauty. The entire web of lies that predicated the tragedy would seem ripped from the headlines today, and it certainly was back then \u2014 the son of the man who wrote the National Anthem versus one of the most promising young politicians in the country. The Sickles couple was among the top hosts in tony Washington society; the New York Democrat was a close ally of then-President James Buchanan and had carefully selected a home just a block away from the White House. Key was a frequent guest at their lavish events but, unbeknownst to Sickles, Key was there even more often escorting Sickles' wife about town (and inside his own home) when he was back in New York. It seemed everyone in town knew about their dalliance, except for Sickles himself, until he received an anonymous letter about a nearby house Key had rented for their frequent rendezvous. The question here isn't whodunit \u2014 Sickles shot the 40-year-old Key dead in the middle of the street in broad daylight, mere steps away from the executive mansion as Key wailed \"Murder! Murder!\" amidst myriad onlookers. Sickles even turned himself in shortly after, so there was little doubt about who pulled the trigger and administered the fatal shots. Instead, Sickles' team of high powered attorneys \u2014 which included Edwin Stanton, the soon-to-be secretary of war to President Lincoln and a controversial figure in his own right \u2014 tried an untested legal defense strategy of a temporary insanity in an effort to sway the jury to acquit their client. The defense was coupled with the insinuation that it was a justifiable homicide due to the code of honor Key had broken by defiling his marriage bed. Ultimately, the trial set a precedent for centuries to come. A Star Spangled Scandal leaves you with larger questions and observations about more than America's long-running obsession with crime. It's clear that the justice system tilts more in favor of those with a high social standing and the means to hire the best lawyers. And public opinion clearly held a major sway in this case, with most seeming sympathetic toward Sickles as ridding them of a man who could have preyed upon their own wives one day. In fact, Key (though deceased) was himself put up on trial in a way, cast as a handsome playboy whose nefarious wiles simply led Mrs. Sickles astray. Key, who was a widower, allegedly often bragged \"I only need thirty-six hours with any woman to make her do what I please.\" It also shows how women back then (and even sometimes now) are seen as something to be owned or possessed. Sickles' outrage over Teresa's tryst with Key seems to be driven more by the humiliation that her infidelity caused him \u2014 and the fact that he seemed to be the last person in the small Washington D.C. social circles to find out \u2014 than it does for any deep affection for her or a desire to keep his family intact. He's distraught for sure, but it's never fully clear where that emotion is coming from. In fact, Sickles forced his wife to write out the sordid details of her year-long affair with Key once he presented her with the proof he'd found out, and had witnesses sign her confession, writing that \"I did what is usual for a wicked woman to do,\" and demanded her wedding ring returned. Though Sickles didn't want the letter made public to protect his daughter, much to the chagrin of his lawyers, the torrid details were eventually leaked to the press during his trial causing a gawking not unlike that of the \"Reynolds Pamphlet.\" This crime also coincided with the growth of mass media \u2014 not just penny newspapers that relied on the most salacious stories to sell papers but also the widespread use of the telegraph to more rapidly relay information across the country that in the past had relied on rail or horse. (A titillating detail DeRose notes is that people would even connect and find dates over the telegraph. So if you thought online dating apps were bad, imagine a \"Hey, u up?\" in Morse code). The trial was fodder for gossip and conversation, not just in Washington salons but across the country, and it was front page news in major dailies. That makes it not hard to imagine how such an affair would play out today \u2014 because it already has many times over. The Sickles prosecution was the O.J. Simpson trial of its day \u2014 and while not televised, newspaper scribes were quick to push out any tidbit as fast as they could. If this event had happened in present day, Twitter would be abuzz, major networks would carry the proceedings live \u2014 and his guilt or innocence would be all cable news pundits would talk about. DeRose outlines the trial in great detail, with testimony, objections and both sides' main arguments laid out in vivid writing. It's not hard to imagine how Law & Order would dramatize the crime or the made-for-TV movie that would follow. In fact, one reporter who covered the trial did fashion it into a play. Here's a 160-year spoiler alert, if you don't want to know the ending: Sickles goes free and is celebrated across the country, along with the \"Unwritten Law\" precedent that his murder of his wife's lover set. In fact, what outrages many people the most is that he reconciles with his wife, or at least appears to, though she dies shortly thereafter from tuberculosis. All this happens just months before the entire country explodes into the Civil War, so perhaps the rancor that led to a sitting member of Congress killing a federal prosecutor shouldn't have been that shocking, along with the acceptance of such a crime. Philip Barton Key himself had very leniently prosecuted South Carolina Rep. Preston Brooks after he bashed in the skull of Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner following an argument over slavery and slave states. And if such a scene ever happened today, take a minute to imagine what the coverage of such a crime \u2014 and the political divides emanating out of such a tragedy \u2014 would be like. Would they really be that different? Perhaps not. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

        "title": "Chief Justice Roberts' Supreme Court Long Game Is Feared And Loathed : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: In this country, what are the motivations of the man who runs the Supreme Court? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ROBERTS: We'll hear argument this morning in case 18-966 - the Department of Commerce v. New York. INSKEEP: John Roberts commonly calls cases to order and is also a vital player as justices decide how to rule. He recently infuriated the president with one of his rulings. He wrote a 5-4 decision blocking a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. NPR's Nina Totenberg has been talking with people who observe the chief justice. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: What was he thinking? That's the question. For some conservatives, the chief justice's vote in the Census case was another original sin, much like his vote in 2012 to uphold key provisions of Obamacare. Some even called for Roberts' impeachment. Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, doesn't go that far. But... CURT LEVEY: What it means is that having a conservative majority on the court is still a dream rather than a reality. TOTENBERG: And yet, even Levey concedes that Roberts has been a reliable conservative vote on the court, the census case being the only 5-4 case this term in which he voted with the court's liberals. If liberals were relieved that Roberts recognized that the administration's justification for adding the census question was essentially a lie, they were infuriated by Roberts' other major opinion. Writing for himself and the court's four other conservatives, the chief justice slammed the door shut on court challenges to extreme partisan gerrymanders. The decision will allow some state legislators unfettered discretion to draw congressional and state legislative district lines so as to entrench their own political power. It isn't just liberals who've pushed for some court supervision of extreme partisan gerrymandering. CHARLES FRIED: There's no doubt there's an agenda here. TOTENBERG: Harvard Law professor Charles Fried served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration. But he and other Republican former officeholders filed a brief on behalf of those challenging extreme partisan gerrymanders. Alluding to Roberts' famous confirmation hearing comment that the job of a judge is not to bat for one side but to call balls and strikes, Fried had this to say. FRIED: This is not balls and strikes. This is a long-term, shrewdly played but persistent program to get the law out of anything to do with elections. TOTENBERG: Fried catalogs Roberts' decisions in this regard. He wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision striking down the Voting Rights Act, a law passed and reenacted repeatedly by large and bipartisan congressional majorities. He wrote or participated in a series of decisions striking down longstanding and newer limits on campaign contributions. These and other decisions, however, are not enough to satisfy Roberts' conservative critics, who view him as something of a traitor - mainly for the Obamacare and census decisions. Again, Curt Levey. LEVEY: He often does appear like he's very focused on his legacy and on being popular rather than on doing what a judge should do. All the pressure from the mainstream media and the establishment is to move left. TOTENBERG: Others have a different explanation. Josh Blackman is a constitutional law professor at Southwest (ph) College of Law Houston. JOSH BLACKMAN: I think Roberts is motivated by some sort of Solomonic dogma, that in any given case of high note that the correct decision is one where he splits a proverbial baby. TOTENBERG: Of course, chief justices, Republican and Democrat alike, have uniformly believed that they have a particular duty to maintain public confidence in the court as an institution. For instance, in 2000, then-Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion upholding a decision he had long reviled, the decision that, 34 years earlier, required police to warn criminal suspects of their rights. And in the 1930s, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes worked hard behind the scenes, on the court and off, to prevent Franklin Roosevelt's court-packing plan. Today Chief Justice Roberts faces similar threats - a president who openly and repeatedly castigates judges in partisan and even ethnic terms; and Democratic presidential contenders who make a different case. They argue that Republicans, by refusing for nearly a year to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, have so stacked the deck that the number of justices on the court should be expanded by statute if the Democrats take control of the Senate. As some who know Roberts observe, while these kinds of proposals are still in their relative infancy, the chief justice cannot ignore the alarm bells. He knows that if the court moves too far to the right and too fast, those bells will only ring louder. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.

        "title": "Iran's Uranium Enrichment Breaks Nuclear Deal Limit. Here's What That Means : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Iran is now enriching uranium above limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal. That's the word from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's nuclear facilities. Earlier today, Vice President Mike Pence offered this warning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Under President Donald Trump, America will never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. (CHEERING) SHAPIRO: That's Pence speaking at a conference in Washington earlier today. And joining us now to discuss Iran's nuclear activities is NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, who covers science and security for us. Hey, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the vice president's comment there. Is that what Iran is trying to do - get a nuclear weapon? BRUMFIEL: Well, at the moment it looks like the answer to that question is no. So you need a little enrichment 101 here. Buckle up. SHAPIRO: OK. BRUMFIEL: Only a tiny fraction of the uranium that gets dug out of the ground can actually be used for things like nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons. And so what the process of enrichment is doing is actually concentrating that level. If you enrich to about 5%, that's good for a reactor. Closer to 90% is what you really need for a nuclear bomb. Now, under the nuclear deal, Iran promised to keep it pretty low, at 3.67%. Just over the weekend, Iran announced it was going to be going up to around 4 1/2%. That's still way below bomb-grade. SHAPIRO: So if they're not sprinting in that direction towards a nuclear weapon, what are they actually doing? BRUMFIEL: What they're doing is sending a message. The U.S. pulled out of this nuclear agreement last year, and they've been making Iran's life pretty miserable ever since. They've reimposed a ton of sanctions, and they've also imposed sanctions on anyone who does business with Iran. But the U.S. isn't the only party to the nuclear deal. Europe, China and Russia were also supposed to provide Iran economic benefits. And so Iran is crossing these lines in the deal to really try and ramp up the pressure on those other parties to give them some sort of economic benefit to remain at the deal. And they've said that they're going to cross another line in 60 days if they don't start seeing those benefits, although it's unclear exactly what that line would be. SHAPIRO: So some of this is signaling using uranium enrichment to send a message, but technically it does also get Iran closer to having what they need to build a nuclear weapon, right? BRUMFIEL: It does. I mean, I would call it a baby step. Most of the experts I've spoken to about this were actually concerned. We knew Iran was going to make some sort of announcement. They were concerned that it might be Iran going all the way to 20% right away or near 20% enrichment. That would be a big step toward getting a nuclear weapon. So Iran is showing restraint here. They're clearly trying to slowly ratchet up the pressure. SHAPIRO: So how would we know if Iran does decide to start racing toward a nuclear weapon? What signs would we see? BRUMFIEL: Well, the enrichment levels could go up much, much higher. The other thing to watch for is right now there are all these nuclear inspectors crawling around Iran's facilities, and they're the ones who can say, yes, they've gone over this limit; no, they haven't. Iran may decide to kick them out, and that would be a very, very serious step that would indicate that maybe their intentions were changing. SHAPIRO: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images hide caption The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court decided a property rights case that overturned decades of precedent. A sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday that property owners can go directly to federal court with claims that state and local regulations effectively deprive landowners of the use of their property. The 5-4 decision overturned decades of precedent that barred property owners from going to federal court until their claims had been denied in state court. Federal courts are often viewed as friendlier than state courts for such property claims. The decision, with all five of the court's conservatives in the majority, may have particular effects in cities and coastal areas that have strict regulations for development. Property owners and developers often have complained that zoning rules and other state and local regulations effectively take their property for public benefit, and that the Constitution requires that they be paid just compensation. The court's decision came in the case of Rose Mary Knick, who owns 90 acres of land in Scott Township, Pa. Knick's home and a grazing area for her horses are on the land, as well as a small cemetery where her neighbors' ancestors are allegedly buried. When the town enacted a rule requiring all cemeteries be open to the public during daytime hours, Knick went to state court seeking a judgment that the state had in effect taken her property. When the town withdrew its notice that she was violating the local cemetery law, the state court said Knick could not prove that she was being harmed. So, she went to the federal courts, which threw out her case based on decades-old Supreme Court decisions that have consistently required property owners to go to the state courts before appealing to the federal courts. On Friday, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the first of those decisions, a 1985 ruling that required property owners to take their complaints to the state courts first. Instead, the court majority said Knick and other property owners seeking compensation for limits on their property rights may go directly to federal court. \"We now conclude that the state litigation requirement imposes an unjustifiable burden\" on a property owner's claim that his or her land has been effectively taken for public benefit without the government paying just compensation, wrote Chief Justice John Roberts. In essence, Roberts said, property owners are entitled to the same rights in federal court that other citizens have if they can prove that their constitutional rights have been violated. Justice Elena Kagan, joined by the court's three other liberal justices, dissented in furious tones. Friday's decision, she said, \"rejects far more than a single decision in 1985.\" That decision, Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, \"was rooted in an understanding of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause stretching back to the late 1800s, Kagan wrote. On that view, a government could take property so long as it provided a reliable mechanism to pay just compensation, even if the payment came after the fact,\" Kagan said, adding, \"No longer.\" In conflict with \"precedent after precedent,\" she said, the majority holds that a government violates the Constitution whenever it takes property without advance compensation, no matter how good its commitment to pay. The consequence, she added, is \"to channel a mass of quintessentially local cases involving complex state-law issues into federal courts.\" The \"entire idea\" of abiding by precedent, she said, is that \"judges do not get to reverse a decision just because they never liked it in the first instance.\" Rather, she said, they need a reason other than that the precedent was wrongly decided. \"It is hard to overstate the value, in a country like ours, of stability in law,\" said Kagan, pointing so a similar observation by one of her colleagues just weeks ago. On May 13, Justice Stephen Breyer chastised his conservative colleagues for reversing a precedent on a question that rarely arises: \"Today's decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next.\" \"Well that didn't take long,\" opined a caustic Kagan. \"Now one may wonder yet again.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Iran says it is now enriching uranium above the limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal. Vahid Salemi/AP hide caption An Iranian security official in protective clothing walks through a uranium conversion facility in 2005. Iran says it is now enriching uranium above the limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal. Updated on Monday at 12:40 p.m. ET Iran has crossed another line set in the 2015 nuclear deal between it and major world powers. According to state media, Iran has begun enriching uranium above levels enshrined in the agreement. The move sends a signal that Iran is losing patience with a deal that has not provided the economic relief promised, more than a year after the United States withdrew from the agreement. By Monday, Iran had reached levels of around 4.5% enrichment, Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told the semiofficial Fars news agency. He warned that Iran could go as high as 20% in the future, though that level is \"not needed now.\" Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran has crossed the line. On Sunday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran would go over some other unspecified limit again in 60 days, raising pressure on diplomatic negotiations. \"This is to protect the nuclear deal, not to nullify it. ... This is an opportunity for talks. And if our partners fail to use this opportunity, they should not doubt our determination to leave the deal,\" Araghchi said. Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to keep its enrichment of uranium below 3.67% purity. It was one of several limits set in an effort to keep Iran at least a year away from accumulating enough material with which to build a nuclear bomb. In exchange for holding down enrichment levels, Iran was supposed to see economic sanctions lifted and more opportunities for trade. But the U.S. reimposed the sanctions it had promised to lift and is demanding that other countries cut off most business with Iran. The Trump administration says it's trying to force Iran to renegotiate a tougher deal and change its behavior in the Middle East. Now, Iran is hurting for cash as oil and other exports dwindle. Iran says it will stop meeting its commitments under the nuclear deal unless European countries and other trade partners find a way to provide the economic benefits it was originally promised. What is enrichment anyway? Uranium is found in nature, but not all uranium is useful as a nuclear fuel. One particular isotope, uranium-235, can be used to power nuclear reactors and bombs. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.7% of the uranium that's dug out of the ground. Enrichment is the process of concentrating the uranium-235 to higher levels. At about 3% to 5%, enriched uranium can be used for nuclear power reactors of the sort that exist in many nations all over the world. At 20%, it's used in certain kinds of research reactors, which are less common. Closer to 90% is considered weapons grade. Iran is one of only a few nations that possesses enrichment technology. To what level is Iran enriching its uranium? Before the nuclear deal, Iran had begun enriching large quantities of uranium to nearly 20%. For technical reasons, the gap from 20% to 90% is relatively small, and most experts agreed that the country was within weeks or a few months of getting material for a bomb, if it decided to \"sprint\" toward such a goal. But Iran never did. Instead, it opted to surrender a large quantity of its 20% enriched uranium in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The uranium was diluted and then exported to Russia, according to Corey Hinderstein, vice president for international fuel cycle strategies at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a former Obama administration official who helped oversee the deal. Iran also shut down some of the equipment used to enrich uranium \u2014 devices known as centrifuges. Under the deal, Iran continued to enrich, but it stopped at the limit set in the agreement. \"That limit, 3.67%, is in the Iran nuclear deal, and it's there for a reason,\" Hinderstein says. It was one of the numbers that kept Iran from producing a bomb quickly. After Trump was elected, Iran kept to the deal in the hopes that the other parties, including Europe, China and Russia, would continue to provide economic benefits. But the Trump administration has threatened secondary sanctions on any entity that does business with Iran. Now Iran says it is enriching past the levels set by the agreement. Technically, it can be done with no modifications to Iran's enrichment setup, says Houston Wood, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Virginia. \"It's a really simple thing for them to do.\" Didn't Iran cross another line recently? In addition to being required to keep its enrichment levels low, Iran was also restricted in how much uranium it could have. Under the agreement, it could have no more than 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of 3.67% enriched uranium. On July 1, Iran said that it had exceeded the 300-kilogram cap. The International Atomic Energy Agency later confirmed that Iran had crossed that line. So is Iran within \"weeks\" of getting enough material for a nuclear weapon again? No. It will take Iran time to enrich uranium back to higher levels and to accumulate enough enriched uranium for a weapon. Because of the way the nuclear deal was structured, Iran is still about a year away from getting the material together again, according to Hinderstein. But that time will likely shrink in coming months, unless the deal can be salvaged. Iran continues to officially maintain that its program is peaceful and that it does not want a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency has found evidence of a nuclear weapons program in Iran that was active until the mid-2000s. Is there any way to stop Iran from going down this road? Iran has said it is willing to go back to the deal if it is given the economic benefits it was promised. That will be difficult as long as the U.S. continues to enforce strict sanctions on the nation. But there is not another obvious way to stop Iran from accumulating dangerous levels of nuclear material. Sabotage efforts and assassinations have slowed the country's program in the past, but such methods have been unable to stop Iran outright. Similarly, military action against Iran's nuclear facilities would probably set the program back, but only temporarily. \"You just can't bomb their program out of existence,\" says David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security. \"I think what you're left with is negotiations.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images hide caption The U.S. Supreme Court is continuing to allow Congress to delegate the details on a law's implementation, but there was a landmine in the decision. Lost in the shuffle Thursday at the Supreme Court \u2014 with the major decision released in a separation of church and state case dominating \u2014 was another ruling that could, at some point, have wide ramifications for how American government functions. The court ruled that Congress did not overstep its authority in handing off important power to the attorney general under the federal Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORNA. The court's decision came on a 5-3 vote, but only four justices agreed on the reasoning. There was a landmine in the decision, however. With the fifth vote, Justice Samuel Alito said that if a majority of the court were willing to reexamine its long-held position, he might be willing to do the same. For now, he was not willing to go that far, but that could change. At issue in the case is the practice that allows federal agencies to write rules and make decisions about enforcing legislation enacted by Congress. This affects any law Congress passes, from the sex-offender statute in this case to, for example, the Affordable Care Act and on. Those who warn about the power of the so-called administrative state, or the \"deep state,\" often contend that Congress frequently violates the Constitution by delegating legislative power to other government agencies. That theory is called the \"non-delegation doctrine,\" but, in fact, the Supreme Court has only twice in its history struck down a federal law on such grounds, and those two cases were in 1935 when a conservative Supreme Court used the theory to invalidate two significant administration reforms aimed at pulling the country out of the Great Depression. In the 84 years since then, the court has repeatedly refused to make a similar decision. Even conservative icons like the late Justice Antonin Scalia refused invitations to revisit it. But in Thursday's case, Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts said the time had come to draw a line in the sand. The court's newest appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, did not vote in the case, as he arrived at the court a week after this case was argued. That left Alito, with the whip hand \u2014 either to cast his lot with the three or with the court's liberals. He sided with the liberals, but said if a majority of the court were willing to revisit the issue in a different context, he might be willing also. \"If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years,\" Alito said, \"I would support that effort.\" This case was about more than one sex offender At issue in this case was whether the Sex Offender Registration Act required those convicted before SORNA was passed to register as sex offenders. When SORNA was enacted in 2006, Congress did not say explicitly whether its provisions applied to people convicted before passage of the law. In 2008, then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey, in setting out rules for implementing the statute, elected to apply the law to some pre-act offenders. Herman Gundy was sentenced to 10 years in prison on a child rape charge in Maryland in 2005, a year before SORNA was enacted. He served seven years of a 10-year sentence before being released to a halfway house in New York. He was charged with failing to register as a sex offender there, but Gundy's lawyers claimed that the registration requirement should not apply to their client, because it was enacted after his offense. They maintained that Congress could not delegate this much power to the attorney general. The Supreme Court majority rejected that argument on Thursday. Writing for a four-justice plurality, Justice Elena Kagan said Congress, in enacting SORNA and other legislation, had made clear that the law was to apply to all sex offenders, whether they were convicted before SORNA's passage or afterward. \"Indeed, if SORNA's delegation [of power] is unconstitutional, then most of Government is unconstitutional \u2014 dependent as Congress is on the need to give discretion to executive officials to implement its programs,\" Kagan wrote. Quoting Justice Scalia, she added, \"Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\" Justice Gorsuch's dissenting opinion, 32-pages long, was almost twice as long as Kagan's plurality. \"The Constitution does not permit judges to look the other way, \" he wrote. \"We must call foul when the constitutional lines are crossed. Indeed, the framers afforded us independence from the political branches in large part to encourage exactly this kind of fortitude to do our duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution.\" Could that be a sign of things to come in a case in the not-too-distant future? It could depend on how Justice Kavanaugh would decide. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Mexican National Guard members prevent Central American migrants from trying to cross the Rio Grande from Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, on June 21. Under pressure from President Trump's tariffs threat, Mexico reached a deal with the United States on June 7 to step up immigration enforcement and to take in more migrants waiting for their U.S. asylum hearings. The agreement reads: \"Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution.\" The deal came at a critical time: Families continue to flee Central America by the thousands for a better life in the north. Getting Mexico to take strong action was President Trump's latest move to reverse this trend. Here is a look at how it's going. What is Mexico doing to ramp up immigration enforcement? The Mexican government's main promise was to deploy its National Guard, even if it had not officially been created yet. NPR has seen many members of the new force still wearing army or marine uniforms but with National Guard armbands. About 6,500 guard members are deployed near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala and another 15,000 are patrolling the northern part of Mexico, on its side of the U.S. border, according to Mexican officials. The National Guard is working, often alongside immigration enforcement agents, to prevent migrants from entering Mexico from Guatemala in the south, and to stop them from leaving to the U.S. in the north. A member of Mexico's new National Guard watches over the Suchiate River to prevent illegal border crossings from Guatemala into Mexico's southern border in Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas state. Cristopher Rogel Blanquet/Getty Images hide caption A member of Mexico's new National Guard watches over the Suchiate River to prevent illegal border crossings from Guatemala into Mexico's southern border in Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas state. Mexico's immigration agency added more checkpoints on highways in the south, where they search buses and cars for undocumented migrants. Officials have stepped up raids of a freight train people call La Bestia, or The Beast \u2014 long known as a quick and free, but risky, way for migrants to travel north. Several bus companies in the country now require immigration documents to purchase a ticket. The Mexican government is hiring new immigration agents as well as transferring federal police to the institution. But 500 immigration agents were fired in June as part of an anti-corruption effort, according to the agency's new director, Francisco Gardu\u00f1o Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. He said many had been involved in human trafficking and extorting migrants. Mexico also said it would dismantle people-smuggling networks. While a few large trucks have been caught secretly carrying dozens or hundreds of migrants north, these busts were fairly common before the surge and Mexico has yet to detail advances on breaking up smuggling networks. Some reporting suggests smugglers continue to thrive. What about asylum-seekers? It can take months or even years to wait for asylum in the United States. Mexico agreed with the U.S. to expand the Migrant Protection Protocols, a program commonly known as \"Remain in Mexico.\" Under MPP, some of the migrants crossing the border to request asylum in the U.S. are sent back to Mexico to wait for their day in U.S. immigration court. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. But there are problems with the program. Asylum-seekers are sent to cities including Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Nuevo Laredo, some of the most violent in Mexico. Migrants in the program have reported being kidnapped, extorted and raped after returning to Mexico. Government and nonprofit shelters are overwhelmed and migrants say they receive little or no support from the Mexican government. The conditions are so bad that many asylum-seekers have voluntarily been bused back to their home countries by Mexican and United Nations authorities. The legal process for people under MPP is confusing, constantly changing and erodes due process, according to lawyers representing the asylum-seekers. Human rights advocates say migrants detained in Mexico are often denied the opportunity to request asylum before being deported. Mexican authorities have registered a record number of people seeking asylum in Mexico this year. The national refugee agency says 31,355 people requested asylum in Mexico in the first half of 2019, the largest portion of whom were from Honduras. That is already more than last year's overall total. With an annual budget of just $1.2 million, the agency's director says, it needs more funds and resources to process the applications and resettle those granted protection. The country granted asylum in 53% of completed cases in 2018, led by a 98% approval rate for Venezuelans. Roughly a third of Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran applicants were granted asylum here in 2018. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Since 2014, Washington has provided more than $100 million to help Mexico with immigration control, including equipment and training, according to a Congressional Research Service report published last month. The U.S. has allocated millions more in asylum and refugee assistance for Mexico. But the June deal did not include additional support. Is this the first time Mexico has cracked down on migrants? No. Mexico's last major immigration enforcement effort started in 2014, after thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the U.S. border. Mexico launched the Southern Border Plan with support of the armed forces to catch migrants at a geographical bottleneck in southern Mexico called the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Subsequently, the U.S. began providing financial support and training to Mexican immigration authorities through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In 2015, In the first full year of this plan, Mexico increased migrant apprehensions by 50% to 180,000 and deportations by 68% to 177,000, but those numbers have ebbed and flowed since. Some experts see the current efforts as a ramp-up of the Southern Border Plan. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. What have been the results this time? In June 2019, in the weeks following the deal the Trump administration reached with Mexico's government, the U.S. saw a 28% drop in the number of people detained after crossing the Southwest border, the first decrease in a year. A number of factors including, summer heat, were probably at work, but the decline was likely driven in part by Mexican enforcement. Mexico detained more than 29,000 migrants that month, up 200% compared with June 2018. Deportations totaled nearly 22,000 in June 2019, up 180% from June 2018. Both are Mexico's highest monthly totals in more than a decade. These trends could waver as the number of people traveling toward the U.S. usually drops in hotter summer months. The Remain in Mexico plan has also expanded in recent weeks since the U.S.-Mexico deal. From Jan. 26 when the program began until April 8 (when the program was briefly suspended), the U.S. returned 1,323 people to Mexico. From April 16 until June 7, another 9,060 were returned to Mexico. Since the U.S.-Mexico deal was signed June 7, another 8,110 have been sent back to Mexico, nearly doubling the total of the previous four months combined. As of July 7, a total of 18,503 people had been sent back to Mexico, according to the country's National Migration Institute. Who is getting caught in the dragnet and why are they leaving their countries?

Under increasing U.S. pressure to reduce the flow of Central Americans through Mexican territory, Mexico's government has stepped up enforcement. Felix Marquez/AP hide caption Detained migrants huddle together in a storage room at the back of the Azteca Hotel where they tried to hide from Mexican immigration agents conducting a raid, in Veracruz, Mexico, June 27. Under increasing U.S. pressure to reduce the flow of Central Americans through Mexican territory, Mexico's government has stepped up enforcement. Most migrants Mexico has detained in 2019 come from Central America. Hondurans represent 46%, Guatemalans 26%, and Salvadorans 10% of the total migrants apprehended by Mexico this year. Much of the region called the Northern Triangle \u2014 Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2014 continues to suffer from violent crime, poverty, climate change and other factors that have driven families to flee in droves. Smaller groups include Haitians (3%) and Cubans (5%). Some Haitians are fleeing economic and political instability, while others previously escaped after the 2011 earthquake and have spent years traveling from country to country in the Americas. The reason Cubans travel through Mexico largely goes back to President Barack Obama ending a Cold War-era policy that allowed Cubans fleeing the country to be eligible for U.S. residency a year after setting foot on U.S. soil. So instead of Cubans trying to reach the U.S. by sea, which could lead to quick arrest and deportation, they now fly to other nearby countries like Nicaragua and Guyana and make their way over land to the U.S.-Mexico border to request asylum. Many Nicaraguans, who make up 2% of those detained, are fleeing their country's prolonged political crisis marked by repression and political persecution from President Daniel Ortega. Other migrants traveling through Mexico come from as far as Africa and Asia. More than 1,000 Cameroonians have been detained in Mexico so far this year, as a violent conflict in the central African nation between its majority French-speaking and minority English-speaking populations continues. More than 1,000 Congolese have also been caught passing through Mexico, as years of brutal conflict continue to force people out. Hundreds of migrants from Angola, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have also been detained in Mexico this year. Why they all choose the U.S. as their destination varies, largely combining reasons related to safety, economic opportunity and family ties in the country. What is the end goal? The Trump administration says it wants to reduce the number of Central American immigrants and asylum-seekers crossing the Southwestern border. The U.S.-Mexico agreement says: \"Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced within 90 days, if necessary.\" But it never says what \"expected results\" means. The countries agreed to reconvene after 45 days from the start of the deal, roughly in late July, to assess progress. But there is no protocol for what happens then. After long criticizing Mexico's handling of immigration, President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on July 1 that he was pleased with Mexico's recent efforts. The lack of clear goals leaves Mexico in a weak bargaining position. It also leaves the country vulnerable to factors outside its control, like a worsening crisis in any of the migrants' home countries. Additionally, Mexico may not gain anything from the agreement as it stands, beyond improving its immigration control. But it can hold off U.S. tariffs, a pressure tactic President Trump has used on other countries. If Mexico fails to satisfy Trump's demands, the next step could for Mexico to enter into a \"safe third country\" agreement with the U.S. That would mean that asylum-seekers who travel through Mexico would have to apply for protection in that country, and would be ineligible to do so in U.S. Mexico may be stopping more migrants from getting to the U.S. and taking in more asylum-seekers for now, but there's no evidence yet of progress toward \"resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation,\" as the agreement says.

Anthony Kwan/Getty Images hide caption Protesters demonstrate outside the Chief Executive Office on Monday in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has apologized publicly twice for proposing a bill to allow extraditions to mainland China, and now other senior officials have followed suit. But a week after the legislation set off massive protests, the largely youth-driven opposition movement is keeping up its demands. Protest organizers are urging Lam to permanently withdraw the bill and resign. Yet the issue has laid bare a broader crisis beyond the extradition bill. Hong Kong is reckoning with its tricky relationship with the Chinese authorities in Beijing, in a clash between two starkly different systems. Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, under an agreement \u2014 \"one country, two systems\" \u2014 that allows the city to keep its capitalist economy and common law system untouched until 2047. Initially following the deal, China dealt with Hong Kong with a light touch because of the city's financial power. \"You didn't want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg,\" says Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of China at the University of California, Irvine. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, speaks at a news conference on June 15. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images hide caption Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, speaks at a news conference on June 15. A major appeal of doing business in Hong Kong is its special arrangement that connects it to the Chinese mainland and other Asian markets, but with its own legal protections. That includes forbidding the extradition of criminal suspects to other parts of China, a crucial part of what safeguards Hong Kong from the country's Communist Party-controlled judiciary. But, following a murder case in Taiwan, Lam attempted to change the rule by proposing the extradition bill \u2014 triggering some of Hong Kong's largest protests in decades. Under public pressure, the leader shelved the bill but did not kill it. Protest organizers say they will confer with pro-democracy lawmakers to plan their next moves. Many Hong Kongers realize the territory's semi-autonomous system not only protects them but has contributed much to China's rapid economic growth. \"We have been providing the largest amount of foreign direct investment to China\" for most of the past four decades, notes Hong Kong opposition lawmaker Alvin Yeung. He tried unsuccessfully to meet with Lam last week, to persuade her to scrap the extradition bill. Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong speaks to the media shortly after he was released from prison on Monday in Hong Kong. Carl Court/Getty Images hide caption Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong speaks to the media shortly after he was released from prison on Monday in Hong Kong. But a decade ago, as Western economies reeled from the 2008 financial crisis, other Chinese cities began catching up with Hong Kong. Hong Kong's economy, as a proportion of china's GDP, fell from 27% in 1993 to less than 3% in 2017. Much of the flow of capital reversed: Money from the mainland started flooding into Hong Kong real estate and its stock market, one of the largest in the world. Beijing has worked to integrate Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the Pearl River Delta into an economic mega-region. Chinese leaders argued that, as demand from Western markets dried up, Hong Kong's best bet was to bind itself more closely to mainland Chinese markets. These developments strengthened the hand of China's leader Xi Jinping, as he consolidated power, silenced dissenting voices, modernized the military and extended the country's global reach through diplomacy and infrastructure projects. Under Xi, Beijing insisted on vetting candidates for Hong Kong's leadership. Hong Kong's government, meanwhile, jailed the leaders of 2014 pro-democracy protests, disqualified opposition lawmakers, banned a pro-independence party, and effectively expelled a Financial Times editor who hosted an independence advocate at a speaker luncheon. Hong Kong's government also offered no explanation when five sellers of political books disappeared from Hong Kong and Thailand in 2016, only to resurface in Chinese custody. Hong Kongers widely perceived Beijing's hand as being behind these moves, despite the lack of hard evidence. China under Xi has emphasized the central government's authority while downplaying Hong Kong's autonomy. When the one country, two systems policy expires in 2047, it seems Beijing intends to take control of a city that has already been tamed and emptied of any serious resistance. Beijing has long perceived Hong Kong as a base for anti-Communist subversives, and a haven for fugitives from the mainland who often abscond with large sums of money. In a speech last November, a Chinese army general and National Defense University professor named Xu Yan warned fellow educators about what he viewed to be Hong Kong's threat. A video of Xu's speech has been widely viewed in Hong Kong, and interpreted as a sign of Beijing's intent to subjugate Hong Kong. Citing military surveys, Xu said two-thirds of Hong Kong's population fled revolution, famine and poverty in mainland China, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s, and is therefore hostile to the Communist Party. Edmund Cheng, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, notes that Chinese have sought refuge in the city from authoritarian regimes in China for centuries, stretching back to the Song (960-1279) and Qin (221-206 B.C.) dynasties. \"They came here to the periphery to experience and enjoy a different path of life,\" he says. China has long considered Hong Kong to be on the periphery of the empire, and on the fringes of the civilized world, much like other borderlands, such as Tibet, Manchuria and Xinjiang. Xu's prescription: replace British colonial-era textbooks with Chinese ones, to inculcate Hong Kong youth with Beijing's views. Xu asked his audience of educators in Chengdu, China: \"How can we not decolonialize\" Hong Kong? Cheng thinks Xu has a point. \"Unless you change the education system, you're not going to completely change Hong Kong,\" he says. Rather than trying to win over Hong Kong people's hearts and minds, Beijing has largely accused foreign governments and media of inciting unrest in Hong Kong, in an effort to stymie China's growth \u2014 an argument that protesters against the extradition bill generally scoff at. Besides, Cheng argues, the people of Hong Kong are not really intent on subverting the mainland. Hong Kong people did \"want to spread liberalism, maybe in the 1990s and early 2000s,\" he says, \"but because of the shift in political and economic power between the mainland and Hong Kong, I think that most Hong Kong people think that is not going to be feasible.\" Many young Hong Kong residents do not identify with the mainland or even as Chinese, according to polls. Some of them argue that mainland Chinese themselves show scant interest in democracy, so Hong Kongers should focus on defending their own endangered liberties \u2014 which is exactly what they have been doing in response to the extradition law. In Cheng's view, Hong Kongers need no organizers or agitators to respond instinctively to Beijing's assault on their values. \"People certainly know what they're fighting for, and why they need to fight for it,\" he says. \"And that is precisely because [it is] embedded in Hong Kong people's culture and history.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption A stage full of Democratic presidential hopefuls in Miami. The two nights of debates underscored the changes within the party. When history looks back on the first round of debates among Democrats in the 2020 presidential cycle, it will see a generational milestone. Both nights of the twin bill in Miami put the spotlight on a national party in transition, loosening the bonds of its past and looking ahead to new personalities to propel its future. Parties are about people, and also about ideas. The ideas openly discussed this week included free tuition at public colleges, new taxes on wealth and radical action to address climate change. They also included universal health care, medical coverage for undocumented immigrants and the phasing out of private health insurance. All these would have been regarded as outside the mainstream not too long ago, and Republicans will surely argue they are still outside the mainstream today. But we all tend to remember candidate debates for their emblematic moments. And this time around, viewers may remember best the Thursday night confrontation between former Vice President Joe Biden, the best-known political commodity on stage, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who's still a newbie at the national level. In the matter of Harris v Biden TV coverage featured Harris' challenge to Biden's posture on busing for integration \u2014 when he was a senator and Harris was a school girl at a bus stop. Harris was among the first black students in her cohort bused to mostly white schools in an attempt to grant equal opportunities for education, a policy that Harris said helped her and which was bitterly controversial for millions of Americans. Surely Biden had expected someone to raise his history of co-existence with Dixie-flavored Democrats in this debate. Yet he seemed thrown off balance by the onrush of Harris' personal emotion. The prospective nominee of 2020 was clumsily enmeshed in an issue from the 1970s. In fact, through much of the evening, Biden's famous ebullience seemed to have deserted him, leaving a pale shadow of the personality he showed in previous presidential runs. Many faces of a party moving left That was the takeaway video from the second night. But both nights emphasized the Democratic Party's commitment to change \u2014 progressive and even radical change \u2013 as well as its deep investment in the enfranchisement of women, the young and people of color. The new faces on stage personified the change. Three were in their 30s, four in their 40s, with six women, five people of color and an Indiana mayor whose first answer included a mention of his husband. The contrast could scarcely be starker with the party of President Trump, who has said his e-election campaign theme will be \"Keep America Great.\" And it is not just the president who sounds the theme and hearkens back to the America of earlier generations. The crowds at his rallies and the ranks of Republicans in Congress also continue to be dominated by older white males. Given the inevitable and natural force of that contrast, the urgency of the new pulsed through all four hours of these candidate showcases, which brought together 10 candidates on each night and subjected them to promptings from a tag team of five NBC News personalities. But while some of the journalists' questions were pointed, the most memorable moments came largely at the initiative of the candidates. So it was when Harris sailed into Biden on the second night. But if Biden is not the juggernaut some thought he'd be, who benefits? The older candidates Democratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speak at the same time during the Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption Democratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speak at the same time during the Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Standing between Biden and Harris on stage was the man who has run a strong second in the polls \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. At 77, Sanders is a year old than Biden and four years older than when he was when he took on Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sanders benefited in that bid from his differences with Clinton and from the lack of any other competition after the first few debates in 2015. Sanders attracted many young people at the time who were disillusioned with Clinton or eager for something different. The difference Sanders brought this week was not only reminiscent of his anti-capitalist rhetoric from four years ago \u2013 it was a near perfect reprise of it in style and substance. Nothing requires any candidate to evolve on a second go-round, but Sanders was notable for his lack of interest in doing so. Running third in many polls has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who at 70 is also third oldest among the candidates. But Warren exudes physical and intellectual energy, often seeming to literally vibrate with ideas on a wide range of subjects. Her age notwithstanding, Warren has her gender and personal resume to identify her with change. So she came through the week among those seen as gaining ground. The younger candidates But this time around, younger voters can find plenty of candidates who offer freshness far closer to their own age. First and foremost among them is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who at 37 is barely over the Constitutional requirement for the presidency. Buttigieg is the openly gay Indiana Democrat who came to Miami battered by racial confrontations and storm damage back home. But in his direct and low-key way, he tried to use these travails to illustrate his candid approach to problems. His brief remarks on the subject had overtones of then-candidate Barack Obama's race speech in March 2008 in the midst of the controversy over his outspoken pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Although not especially prominent in the Thursday night debate, Buttigieg made his mark \u2013 as he has been doing throughout the year. In this he clearly stands above the other 30-somethings in the pack, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, both members of Congress seen as building name recognition for later career moves. Another member who got on stage this week was Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who is 45. The senators Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., answers a question during a Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., answers a question during a Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Some of the candidates in their 50s on stage this week could also be seen as newcomers in a more typical presidential field. They include four U.S. senators: \u2013 Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Michael Bennet of Colorado. The first three of these had been seen as potential threats to the frontrunners. Each made an effort to be noticed this week, with Booker logging more minutes than any other contestant on Wednesday night and Klobuchar scoring points on women's issues. Gillibrand stood out on Thursday night by interrupting repeatedly in an effort to break through \u2013 a tactic also used by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on the previous night, to mixed reviews. In the end, Booker may have gained the most traction of this group, although the emergence of Harris on Thursday night might dilute some of his appeal to minority voters. The Texans Also worth noting as generational players are the two Texans, both in their mid-40s, whose trajectories seemed to cross while headed in opposite directions this week. On the rise is Julian Castro, 44, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Castro had been seen as a prospect for vice president, but he attracted more notice Wednesday night than in all the campaign to date. Going the other direction is Beto O'Rourke, 46, a former member of Congress best known for a strong but unsuccessful Senate run against Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. O'Rourke has thus far been missing the magic appeal he had in his home state last year, and his rather lackluster appearance this week did little to alter that. The governors Two once or current Western governors in their late 60s also joined the crowd. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington stressed climate change on Wednesday night and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado defended business and bipartisanship on Thursday. One curiosity of the 2020 field is the inclusion of rather obscure candidates who might not have made the stage in another era but who bring something off-beat to the discussion. John Delaney is a former congressman from Maryland who touts his business credentials and stands to the right of the pack on most issues. Delaney has been campaigning steadily since 2017 but has yet to make much headway in the polls, although he did qualify for this round of debates and may continue to do so. Also in the caboose category are other \"brand builders\" such as author Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru who talks about love as a force in politics, and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur who favors creating a base annual income of $12,000 for all adults.

Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images hide caption President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a business leaders event in Beijing on Nov. 9, 2017. The two leaders are expected to discuss trade at this week's Group of 20 summit in Japan. Humiliation. In China, it is a word laden with history and identity that is playing a role in the high-stakes trade war between the U.S. and China. This month, I was visiting China with a small group of journalists for 10 days, and the word \"humiliation\" came up over and over again in conversations both public and private, in meetings with top government officials, university scholars, think tankers and corporate executives. The Chinese clearly like to play the humiliation card. Almost all of them shared the feelings of disrespect and humiliation that course through them when President Trump accuses the country of going back on its word or threatens President Xi Jinping with tariffs. Both country's leaders go head-to-head this week at the Group of 20 summit in Japan. \"The only thing we ask the U.S. to do is respect us,\" said Yu Dunhai, deputy director general at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \"If bullied, China will not simply kneel before the U.S.\" It's worth noting that Yu began his meeting by talking about how China \"is an old country with 5,000 years of history.\" It is this ancient history that the Chinese are very proud of, and they consider a century-long period of subjugation by foreign powers from the 19th to 20th centuries an aberration \u2014 100 years of humiliation. That period was an accumulation of defeats at the hands of foreign powers, starting with, among other things, the Opium Wars and the British in 1842, the French in 1885 and finally the Japanese at least three times, which finally ended with World War II in 1945. The significance of four characters: \"Never forget national humiliation\" Zheng Wang, a scholar of China's politics and foreign relations, zeroes in on four Chinese characters that are etched into national sculptures and monuments and painted on walls all over the country. The four characters, wu wang guo chi, can be literally translated as \"Never forget national humiliation.\" Zheng, who wrote a book with the same title, Never Forget National Humiliation, calls it China's national phrase. While this phrase long existed in Chinese culture, it gained in influence specifically after the 1989 student protests and subsequent crackdown at Tiananmen Square. Zheng says that after that revolt, Communist Party leaders decided the population's views about the country and its values needed to change, and the party launched a dramatic reworking of the country's education system. \"They issued new textbooks and launched a patriotic education campaign,\" says Zheng, a professor in the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. Zheng says he visited China's primary schools, read its history textbooks and traveled the country. In the Communist Party's ideological reeducation of the country's population, humiliation by foreign powers is a strong emotional underpinning of the country's national identity. Chinese stature No matter what the narrative, China can hardly call itself a victim today. It is no longer a Third World country. In fact, China is the world's second-largest economy and hardly cowers under Western domination. It has multibillion-dollar global companies and is the world's largest surveillance state, trained upon its own citizens. In recent decades, China has been quite comfortable throwing its weight around, especially when it comes to forcing foreign companies to share their technical know-how. Zheng points out that in 1989, China's per capita gross domestic product was $304. Last year, that measure, which is generally considered a reflection of a country's standard of living, was around $10,000. \"In one generation, there's been a dramatic development in living standards, and people are very proud of this accomplishment,\" Zheng says. However, he notes, that doesn't change how the Chinese view their place in the world. In fact, because of their accomplishments today, Zheng says, there is a feeling that \"other countries have to respect China.\" Respect and image I met with a broad spectrum of players and intellectuals, and the message was indeed a version of that sentiment. Yu, from China's Foreign Ministry, said of the U.S.: \"We need to treat each other equally.\" David Daokui Li, an economics professor at Tsinghua University, said, \"China is a country that needs respect.\" Zha Daojiong, a professor of international studies at Peking University, said asking China to surrender is \"demeaning and not going to work.\" This is the reason that the Xi-Trump talks are not just about dollars and cents but about image and national pride. It makes Xi's job even tougher as he heads into what Trump calls an \"extended meeting\" at the G-20 summit. The two leaders' high-stakes trade talks come amid the threat of additional tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods imported into the United States. Trade talks with China hit an impasse last month after Trump accused Beijing of reneging on provisions of a tentative agreement. The two countries have since escalated the trade war. Xi is considered one of the strongest leaders of China in decades. Last year, China's laws were changed to effectively allow him to remain president for life. But, given the country's image of itself, Xi has to avoid anything that has the semblance of humiliation even though he is meeting a world leader who has shown no qualms about humiliating others. Allowing the trade war to escalate even further would likely damage China's already slowing economy. What complicates all of this is that Trump's own image is also fragile. He can't come out of any meeting with the Chinese with the impression of being taken advantage of. If Xi caves in to Trump's threats, he risks not just looking weak but as bowing to humiliation rained down from the West once again. But the cost of angering Trump could jeopardize the economic miracle that is China. Pallavi Gogoi is NPR's chief business editor.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren participates in a re-enacted swearing-in with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 3, 2013. In 2005, bankruptcy was on the rise and had been for years. Lawmakers were pondering why, exactly, that was happening \u2014 and what, if anything, they should do about it \u2014 when two future presidential rivals squared off over a bankruptcy overhaul bill that would restrict who could write off their personal debts. In one corner, Joe Biden \u2014 one of the staunchest Democratic advocates for the bill and a senator from Delaware, home to several large credit card companies. He was also a member of the Judiciary Committee, which was debating the bill. In the other corner, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor who had fought against this type of bankruptcy overhaul for years and who was on a panel convened for a hearing over the bill. Their conversation started off with a testy (but weedy) exchange about bankruptcy courts. And it escalated from there, with plenty of interruptions and the occasional barb \u2014 Biden at one point cast Warren's arguments as \"mildly demagogic.\" It ended with a tense dispute over what, exactly, the dispute ought to be. WARREN: [Credit card companies] have squeezed enough out of these families in interest and fees and payments that never pay down principle. BIDEN: Maybe should talk about usury rates. That maybe, that's what we should be talking about, not bankruptcy. WARREN: Senator, I'll be the first. Invite me. BIDEN: Now, I know you will, but let's call a spade a spade. Your problem with the credit-card companies is usury rates, from your position. It's not about the bankruptcy bill. WARREN: But Senator, if you're not going to fix that problem, you can't take away the last shred of protection for these families. BIDEN: OK, I get it. [pause] You're very good, Professor. It was heated debate with a polite, even charming end \u2014 complete with laughter throughout the hearing room, but the stakes are higher now, with both Warren and Biden potentially poised to share a debate stage. And while debate over a 14-year-old bankruptcy bill might otherwise be largely forgotten by now, the 2020 presidential election has made the disagreements between Biden and Warren relevant again \u2014 and shows how their exchange over that 2005 bill show up in their current presidential campaign strategies. With Democrats in the minority in the Senate in 2005, Biden argues he was trying to make a Republican bill better. Warren thought, even then, that it was fundamentally flawed and bad for consumers. What the bill did A major question at the heart of the 2005 bankruptcy bill was why bankruptcies were on the rise. One side \u2014 including Warren and many Democrats \u2014 said it was because people were financially strapped because of major obligations like medical debt, and that credit card companies were exacerbating the problem. Others \u2014 largely Republicans, but also some Democrats, like Biden \u2014 said that it was a combination of irresponsible spending and a system that made it too easy to apply for bankruptcy, leading to abuse. That abuse, these lawmakers argued, leads to higher costs for other people seeking credit. Loading... The 2005 bill restricted who could discharge their debts via Chapter 7 bankruptcy and also made the process more difficult. It included a means test, in the form of comparing a person's income with their state's median income. The goal, proponents argued, was to make sure that people who could still pay their debts weren't able to unfairly escape their debts, while also ensuring that people who couldn't pay were able to get relief. The bill also said that a person had to go through credit counseling before obtaining bankruptcy. Opponents, however, cast bankruptcy as an important financial protection that the legal system provides to people in difficult circumstances. They thought that the bill would make it unduly hard to file, enriching credit card companies in the process. And indeed, as they argued, credit card companies themselves had lobbied for it. Warren and her fellow opponents also argued that bankruptcy was a women's issue, as single and divorced women were disproportionately represented among bankruptcy filers. Passing this type of reform would therefore disproportionately hurt women and children, they said (an argument that Warren pointedly made in a 2002 Harvard Women's Law Review essay that focuses heavily on Biden). A long runup This was not new legislation. Similar bills had been proposed in Congress several times \u2014 it even reached the Oval Office in the final days of Bill Clinton's presidency, but he declined to sign it. Biden and Warren had been on opposite sides during that period, as well \u2014 Biden voted for that 2000 bill, and Warren had counseled Hillary Clinton that it would be bad for consumers. And that was the lay of the land when they met on Capitol Hill. \"This is one of those situations where the current story is not misleading. They were both very key players in this,\" said David Skeel, professor at the University of Pennsylvania law school and the author of a history of bankruptcy. \"Elizabeth Warren was the most important critic of the legislation, and she spent years fighting it. That's what really first got her into the into the public eye,\" he said. \"And Joe Biden was critically important to passing the legislation because credit card companies are very important to Delaware. And that's where he was coming from.\" In the end, the bill passed. And as for the effects, they're complicated. One outcome: The bill included a provision that made obligations like child support and alimony a top priority for debtors to pay off \u2014 which addressed one concern of the bill's opponents. And another, overarching result: Bankruptcies fell sharply afterward. And that's linked to one other effect of the bill, according to Skeel. \"The biggest effect is that it is now more expensive to file for bankruptcy than it used to be,\" Skeel said, \"because of the the so-called means test that was put into the 2005 amendments that requires that debtors fill out forms to determine whether they would be capable of repaying some of what they owe.\" But, crucially, it's not totally clear that that shows a reduction in bankruptcy abuse, he added. Research on the bill also doesn't hand either side a total win. On the one hand, the reform was associated with lower interest rates on credit cards, as Vox's Matthew Yglesias pointed out in an article on the Warren-Biden debate. But, Yglesias argued, studies also suggested that the law meant less access to credit and lower credit scores for some borrowers, not to mention a potentially slower bounce back from the Great Recession. The political fallout Potential 2020 voters have already had a preview of Warren's attacks on Biden. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., attacked Hillary Clinton's vote for a similar 2001 bankruptcy bill \u2014 a vote she took after Warren convinced her it was a bad bill. Sanders used Warren's criticisms as part of his attacks. Warren talked about her disappointment in a 2004 interview with journalist Bill Moyers: WARREN: She voted in favor of it. MOYERS: Why? WARREN: As Sen. Clinton, the pressures are very different. It's a well-financed industry. You know, a lot of people don't realize that the industry that gave the most money to Washington over the past few years was not the oil industry. It was not pharmaceuticals. It was consumer credit products. Credit card companies have been giving money, and they have influence. MOYERS: And Mrs. Clinton was one of them as senator. WARREN: She has taken money from the groups, and more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency. For her part, Clinton argued that she was able to support the bill because it, at that point, included better protections for women seeking child support and alimony. That whole dynamic surrounding the law is repeating itself in this election. \"If you talk to many independent voters, they worry that both parties are funded by the same corporate interests,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren ahead of 2020. \"Elizabeth Warren has been part of the solution trying to re-brand the Democratic Party as being of the people. The credit card fight was just one chapter of that ongoing struggle.\" While Warren uses the fight as evidence of her willingness to fight corporations on behalf of everyday Americans, Biden and his supporters frame the bankruptcy bill as evidence of his practicality \u2014 and they also emphasize protections in the bill like those prioritizing child support. \"Sen. Biden, knowing essentially that the bill was likely to make it through a Republican-led Congress to a Republican-controlled White House, really worked hard to make sure that bill protected middle-class families,\" said Terrell McSweeny, who worked as a Biden staffer just after the bill's passage. And that plays into a larger narrative from the Biden campaign. \"Folks, I'm going to say something outrageous,\" he has said. \"I know how to make government work. Not because I've talked or tweeted about it, but because I've done it. I've worked across the aisle to reach consensus, to help make government work in the past.\" Democratic voters are concerned with far different topics than the bankruptcy bill, like climate change and a health care overhaul. But then, if both candidates remain key contenders for the nomination \u2014 and if they share a debate stage \u2014 there's a good chance the topic will come up again, as a symbol of the differences between the two candidates. And while bankruptcy expert Skeel acknowledges that he's not a political strategist, he does have one political prediction based on the Biden-Warren bankruptcy fight. \"It strikes me that one potential implication,\" he said, \"is it's highly unlikely you will see a Democratic ticket with both of them on it.\" In a previous version of this story, we incorrectly say Joe Biden was the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in 2005. Although he had held that position previously, he did not in 2005. In addition, we misspelled Terrell McSweeny's last name as McSweeney.

Studio Incendo hide caption Activists in Hong Kong protest against an extradition bill on June 16. Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here. Hongkongers are showing the world how to protest. Hong Kong is an autonomous region of China that kind of runs on finance. Its stock exchange is the fifth largest in the world. And it's an attractive base for a lot of multinational companies, partly because Hong Kong has a predictable rule of law. Companies can set up a regional headquarters when selling to China without having to be in mainland China itself. But that predictability is changing. On June 16, around 2 million people marched, according to protest organizers. They're against a proposed law that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, apologized and suspended consideration of the bill. But protesters want the bill permanently withdrawn. Many are calling for Lam's resignation. Will they get what they want? What does research on successful resistance campaigns say? The protesters in Hong Kong have two characteristics that really boost their chances: nonviolence and more than 3.5% of the population having gotten involved. First, why nonviolence? Aren't guns and tanks effective, whether you like them or not? Harvard University political scientist Erica Chenoweth used to believe this. In 2006, she went to a nonviolence workshop and picked a fight. Chenoweth says she told the academics there that she could \"think of plenty of cases where violence worked pretty well, like the Algerian, French and Russian revolutions.\" Maria Stephan, now a director at the U.S. Institute of Peace, was there. She said to Chenoweth, \"If you're really skeptical about nonviolent resistance ... how would you prove that?\" So Chenoweth trawled through 323 campaigns for regime change or self-determination worldwide from 1900 to 2006. Then Stephan and Chenoweth teamed up to write a paper and a book based on the data. They found that major nonviolent campaigns are successful 53% of the time, while violent campaigns are successful only 26% of the time. But does nonviolence cause the higher success rate? Or are you more likely to choose sit-ins over shootouts when you know you're already likely to succeed? When Stephan and Chenoweth factored in additional data on why the campaigns turned violent, peaceful resistance still prevailed. The likelihood of success was not a factor in whether a campaign became violent. \"I was surprised,\" Chenoweth says. \"I expected for there to be, basically, at best no significant difference between armed and unarmed action.\" The next factor: that 3.5% figure. \"One of the frequently asked questions that I'd gotten from activists was how many people it takes,\" Chenoweth says. \"What's the threshold?\" Using historical accounts and news reports, her data set coded the number of people visible on the front lines, whether striking, marching or taking part in a sit-in. Unsurprisingly, the more participants recorded, the higher the likelihood of success. But as the campaign's participation reached 3.5% of the population, that likelihood became seemingly inevitable. Examples include the People Power Revolution in the Philippines and the Rose Revolution in Georgia. \"Above that 3.5% threshold, there hadn't been any failed movements, and that was a little surprising to me in the sense that it's a pretty small threshold,\" Chenoweth says. But Chenoweth is quick to emphasize that 3.5% suggests many multiples more sympathetic to the cause. That brings us back to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's protests were huge: nearly 30% of Hongkongers in the streets by organizers' counts. Even the much lower estimate by the police represents nearly 5%, well past the threshold. Chenoweth says that the protests are more reform minded than the campaigns in her data set. But if the protesters stick to her and Stephan's rules, \"then they're definitely among the types of campaigns that we see generally succeeding in the end.\" Apart from isolated scuffles with police, the protesters have remained nonviolent. Whether the government will fully meet protesters' demands is unclear. What is clear is that the tactics \u2014 and the numbers \u2014 are on the protesters' side. Did you enjoy this newsletter?

        "title": "Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren Bankruptcy Fight Could Come Back In Debates : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The Democratic Party plans this week to announce the lineups for the first batch of 2020 presidential primary debates. For a preview of what these debates might be like, NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben says just watch a 2005 Senate hearing. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Fourteen years ago, Congress was considering an overhaul to the nation's bankruptcy system - one that would restrict who could write off their debts. It might sound boring, except for the people involved - on one side, Delaware Senator Joe Biden, who backed that overhaul; on the other, Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor. Biden questioned her at a congressional hearing, where they argued over what exactly they were arguing over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: Senator, I think you've put your finger on the heart of what the bankruptcy bill - or bankrupt in general not this bill... JOE BIDEN: Forget bankruptcy. I'm asking a larger question. Forget about bankruptcy. WARREN: No, no, but that's what I mean. It's the question of what role bankruptcy plays. BIDEN: That's not my question. I'd like you to answer my question. KURTZLEBEN: At issue is this. Bankruptcy-reform backers often argue that there was too much bankruptcy abuse. Restricting bankruptcy, they reasoned, would stop that from happening. But opponents like Warren emphasized bankruptcy as a basic consumer protection. They singled out some businesses as predatory, like the credit card companies pushing the bill. That industry has a heavy presence in Biden's home state of Delaware. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: They have squeezed enough out of these families in interest and fees and payments that never pay down principle. BIDEN: Maybe we should talk about usury rates. Maybe that's what we should be talking about not bankruptcy. WARREN: Senator, I'll be the first. Invite me. BIDEN: No, I know you will, but let's call a spade a spade. Your problem with the credit card companies is usury rates from your position. It's not about the bankruptcy bill. WARREN: But, Senator, if you're not going to fix that problem, you can't take away the last shred of protection from these families. BIDEN: I got it. OK. You're very good, professor. KURTZLEBEN: According to David Skeel, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who has authored a history of bankruptcy, this wasn't just any argument. DAVID SKEEL: Elizabeth Warren was the most important critic of the legislation, and she spent years fighting it. That's what really first got her into the public eye. And Joe Biden was critically important to passing the legislation. KURTZLEBEN: By the time they fought in that hearing room, Biden and Warren's opposition to each other was well-established. He had supported the bill in the past, and she had repeatedly, harshly criticized him for it. And fights over this type of bill have continued to resurface. In 2016, the Bernie Sanders campaign criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting a bankruptcy overhaul, and they used Warren's words to do it. Here she is talking to Bill Moyers in 2004. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: The credit card companies have been giving money. And they're - they have influence. BILL MOYERS: And Mrs. Clinton was one of them as senator. WARREN: She has taken money from the groups. And more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency. KURTZLEBEN: Now that Warren is herself running, she and her supporters are making a similar argument, using the bankruptcy fight to tell voters that she's willing to take on big companies and that Biden was not. Here's Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. ADAM GREEN: The credit card fight was just one chapter of that ongoing struggle between the corporate Democrat wing and those who want the Democratic Party to be squarely on the side of the people. KURTZLEBEN: Biden and his supporters, meanwhile, frame the bankruptcy bill as evidence of his practicality. Here's Terrell McSweeny, who worked as a Biden staffer just after the bill passed. TERRELL MCSWEENY: Senator Biden, knowing, essentially, that the bill was likely to make it through a Republican-led Congress to a Republican-controlled White House, really worked hard to make sure the bill protected middle-class families. KURTZLEBEN: And that plays into a larger narrative of Biden as an experienced politician who believes in compromise. It's an argument he made in his kickoff speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I've worked across the aisle to reach consensus, to help make government work in the past. I can do that again with your help. KURTZLEBEN: That contrasts between a populist consumer advocate and a consensus-minded establishment figure has sustained itself and has been a recurring theme in this campaign. For his part, bankruptcy expert Skeel acknowledges that he's not a political strategist, but he does have one prediction of his own. SKEEL: It strikes me that one potential implication is it's highly unlikely you will see a Democratic ticket with both of them on it. KURTZLEBEN: It's a long way until that can happen. Until then, there's a good chance this fight could resurface on a debate stage. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "texts": "Keith Woods President Trump listens during a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Oliver Contreras/Getty Images hide caption President Trump listens during a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Editor's note: NPR made the decision, this week, to call President Trump's tweets about a group of Democratic congresswomen, \"racist.\" On this week's Code Switch podcast we discuss why the word \"racist\" was used in this instance with NPR's Standards and Practices Editor, Mark Memmott. We also invited NPR's VP of Newsroom Diversity and Training, Keith Woods, onto the podcast. He argues that it is the job of the public, not journalists, to make this type of characterization. Read his opinion piece, below. (NPR's newsroom has not changed its view on this issue and will continue referring to President Trump's tweet as racist. ) Once again, the president of the United States has used the sniper tower of Twitter to take aim at immigration, race relations and common decency. And once again, journalists are daring their profession to boldly call bigotry what it is: bigotry. Enough of the vacuous \"racially charged,\" \"racially loaded,\" \"racially insensitive\" evasions, they say. It's racist, and we should just call it that. I understand the moral outrage behind wanting to slap this particular label on this particular president and his many incendiary utterances, but I disagree. Journalism may not have come honorably to the conclusion that dispassionate distance is a virtue. But that's the fragile line that separates the profession from the rancid, institution-debasing cesspool that is today's politics. It is precisely because journalism is given to warm-spit phrases like \"racially insensitive\" and \"racially charged\" that we should not be in the business of moral labeling in the first place. Who decides where the line is that the president crossed? The headline writer working today who thinks it's \"insensitive\" or the one tomorrow who thinks it's \"racist?\" Were we to use my moral standards, the line for calling people and words racist in this country would have been crossed decades ago. But that's not what journalists do. We report and interview and attribute. I am not a journalism purist. I came into the profession 40 years ago to tear down the spurious notion of objectivity used to protect a legacy of sexism, xenophobia and white supremacy. The better ideals of truth telling, accountability, fairness, etc. are what give journalism its power, while the notion of \"objectivity\" has been used to obscure and excuse the insidious biases we do battle with today. I've been an informed consumer of the media since my days as a paperboy. I read the Times-Picayune as I delivered it, and the distorted view it offered of black and poor New Orleans told me all I needed to know about \"objectivity.\" We have come miles since then as a profession. But why should I trust that we're all on the same page with our labels now? Weren't last week's tweets racist? Or last year's? Weren't some misogynistic? Vulgar? Homophobic? Sexist? The language of my judgment is generous, and they are my opinion, and they belong in the space reserved for opinions. What's at stake is journalism's embattled claim to be the source of credible news grounded in the kind of deep, fair reporting that exposes injustice and holds powerful people to account. It may be satisfying to call the president's words, or the president himself, racist, given the attacks tweeted from his bully app and so often aimed at our profession. But at what cost? It's already nearly impossible to separate actual journalism from the argumentative noise on the cable networks that dominate so much of public perception. There are already too many journalists dancing day and night on the line that once separated fact and judgment. When that line is finally obliterated and we sink into the cesspool beckoning us to its depths, this historically flawed, imperfect tool for revealing and routing racism will look and sound indistinguishable from the noise and become just as irrelevant. On Sunday, the president tweeted this: \"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" His words mirror those of avowed racists and xenophobes that date back to the birth of this country. Was that moral judgment, my last sentence? I would argue no. I'd call it context, and it doesn't require my opinion, just a basic understanding of history. That's an alternative to labels: Report. Quote people. Cite sources. Add context. Leave the moral labeling to the people affected; to the opinion writers, the editorial writers, the preachers and philosophers; and to the public we serve. We just have to do journalism. For more on this, check out our latest podcast episode, where Keith Woods and NPR's Standards and Practices editor discuss why they disagree on what language to use.

        "texts": "Malaka Gharib It's a brand new ranking. Called the Sustainable Development Goals Gender Index, it gives 129 countries a score for progress on achieving gender equality by 2030. Here's the quick summary: Things are \"good\" in much of Europe and North America. And \"very poor\" in much of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, that's the way it looks in many international rankings, which tackle everything from the worst places to be a child to the most corrupt countries to world happiness. And there are a lot of rankings. Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College and the author of Ranking the World: Grading States as a Tool of Global Governance, used to keep track but stopped counting. \"It's so hard to keep up. I've just sort of given up,\" he says. In 2015, he counted 95 different indexes, with over two-thirds launched after 2001. \"Countries can get index fatigue, not know where to prioritize, become complacent and refuse to pay attention to them,\" notes Jacqueline Muna Musiitwa, an international lawyer based in East Africa. And you do have to wonder: What's the value of creating so many indexes to measure human and economic development when they usually come to the same predictable conclusions? It's easy to understand why groups like to rank. \"Rankings appeal to our notion of who's on top, who's below. And they generate competition,\" says Cooley. Even though the top and bottom countries are often markedly similar, international groups believe that there are benefits to the sorting and ordering. For starters, a ranking can \"name and shame\" countries into trying to do better, says Cooley. Consider the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, which measures how easy it is for a company to set up shop in a given country. It looks at everything from construction permits to access to electricity. It's not a ranking that the general public has likely heard of. But it's a big deal in the world of economic development. In fact, it's so influential that Vladimir Putin in 2012 vowed publicly to move Russia up from 120th place in the Doing Business index to 50th by 2015. Russia did not quite succeed (it landed in 62nd place that year). But the index has spurred real-life policy change. From June 2017 to May 2018, for example, the World Bank found that 128 governments \"introduced a record 314 reforms\" to benefit small- and medium- business entrepreneurs, enable job creation and spur private investment. Another index that has moved countries to action is the African Development Bank's Africa Visa Openness Index. It shows which African countries are making improvements that support free movement of people across the continent. \"Since this index has been in place, several countries, including Ghana and Ethiopia, now allow Africans to get visas on arrival at a border post,\" says lawyer Musiitwa. The researchers with Equal Measures 2030, the new gender index, hope their new index can also inspire change: positive steps for laws and policies that benefit girls and women. Sarah Hendriks, director of gender equality at the Gates Foundation (a funder of this blog and NPR), worked on the index. She says the goal was to \"put data in the hand of gender advocates\" so they can inform their government ministers \"where their country is doing well, where they are falling behind and how the country is performing in meeting [women's] needs.\" To ensure that the index reflects the priorities of those advocates, the researchers teamed up with local organizations in countries like El Salvador, India, Indonesia and Tanzania, and drew from surveys from nearly 600 policymakers and gender advocates. And that's the way things should go, says Dapo Oyewole, an Aspen New Voices fellow working within the Nigerian government. He says that rankings are only useful if there's local buy-in. \"The rankings are only relevant if there's a local champion willing to drive the local changes \u2014 and an appetite from the government itself,\" says Oyewole. Of course, there is a potential risk when countries try to move up. They can game the rankings. Cooley cites an example in a 2015 piece for Foreign Affairs. In 2006, Georgia was in 112th place in the World Bank's Doing Business index. The country put together a working group to \"rapidly pass laws and promulgate administrative rules\" to shoot the country to 37th place in 2007. \"The evidence suggests that the change was more cosmetic than structural,\" Cooley wrote of Georgia's rise up the index. He found that the country's ranking had not improved on \"comparable\" indexes, nor did Georgia produce \"a sustained increase in foreign investment.\" In response to this criticism, World Bank spokesperson Chisako Fukuda told NPR: \"To improve their scores, substantive legislative changes need to be made, which require a strong commitment by governments to improve their business environment.\" Other rankings come in for criticism of another type: They're just kind of vague. Consider Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which attempts to rank the world's countries by how corrupt their public sectors are. \"A fuzzy concept like corruption isn't amenable to unpacking,\" says Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and the author of Results Not Receipts: Counting The Right Things In Corruption. A long-standing criticism from the international community is that the index relies on the perception of corruption to create its rankings. The rankings are based on questionnaires with \"experts and business leaders,\" according to the group. They're asked about a wide range of factors, from evidence of bribery to protections for whistleblowers. That vagueness can make it difficult for local anti-corruption advocates and nonprofits to figure out what they need to do to fight the scourge in their countries: \"Should I try to make the police less corrupt or should I join a government partnership to reduce corruption?\" says Kenny. When NPR asked Transparency International if it has seen any direct links to reform, spokesperson Ferenc Ga\u00e1l responded: \"It is difficult to draw clear causal links between the Index and concrete impact in the form of improvements of the corruption situation in any one country's public sector.\" The group, however, has seen its index make an impression. Advocates against corruption in Nigeria, for example, have cited the country's poor ranking (144th place out of 180 in 2018) in op-eds calling for government reform. As for the fact that many rankings look the same at the top and bottom, one reason has to do with money. Many indexes are correlated with GDP per capita, a measure of a country's prosperity, says Kenny. That includes the World Bank's Human Capital Index, which measures the economic productivity of a country's young people; and Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, which ranks the world by its level of democracy, including economic freedom. And countries that have more money can spend more money on health, education and infrastructure. Musiitwa says it \"annoys\" her when countries in Africa get poor ratings. It can have a negative effect on a country's financial opportunities, she says. \"I know that when investors are looking to do business in Africa, they look at indexes,\" she says, citing the Doing Business index and the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report. \"The rankings provide some kind of guide to show that a country is well-placed to receive an investment, to figure out how stable the environment is.\" But what is more frustrating, she says, is \"when these countries and others that have been good performers slide back.\" Perhaps the true value of the rankings, says Kenny, lies in the outliers: The surprising stories of countries that \"demonstrate that there's space to do better.\" Rwanda, for example, is often at the bottom of economic rankings. But in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report in 2018, which ranked countries by how equal its men and women are, the country was in the top 10. Even for wealthy countries, there are lessons to be learned about what they need to address. Consider the U.S. in Equal Measures 2030's new gender equality index. Although the U.S. is one of the world's wealthiest nations, when it comes to creating fair policies for women and girls, the country is nowhere near the top. The U.S. comes in at 28th place, in between Bulgaria and Greece. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Angela Hsieh hide caption A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services. A visit to a new doctor can be a stressful experience. You know the feeling. Sitting in a cold exam room, naked save for a flimsy gown, waiting for a stranger to poke and prod you. When the doctor finally enters, most of us are looking for signs that we can trust this person, that they are going to help rather than harm us. So what is it that makes us trust doctors enough to allow them to stick needles in our skin or put us on a diet? That's what Owen Garrick wanted to know. He's a doctor and researcher in Oakland, California, and has been trying to improve health outcomes for black men. Black men have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group. Owen says they are dying of preventable or chronic diseases like prostate cancer. \"It's not just prostate cancer; it is cardiovascular disease, it is stroke, it is diabetes.\" Owen and his colleagues wondered what it would take to get black men to go to the doctor for preventative care. They had a hunch that race might be a factor. So they ran a field study to try to answer one simple question: Will black men take more preventative care services if they are randomly assigned to a black doctor? They recruited men from barbershops and flea markets around Oakland. About 600 agreed to go to a clinic for a checkup. The study found that black men assigned to a black doctor did accept more preventative services. And not by a little \u2014 by a lot. The black doctors were about 50 percent more successful than non-black doctors at getting their patients to agree to invasive tests for diabetes and the flu shot. When it came to cholesterol screening, they were 72 percent more effective. The real-life implications could be huge. If people in the real world responded as they did in Owen's study, the gap between blacks and whites in cardiovascular disease outcomes might shrink by nearly 20 percent. \"That could be 20 percent of people living to see their grandkids graduate from college and high school,\" Owen says. \"That's how I think about it.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we travel from medical clinics to school classrooms for a look at how shared identity creates understanding and trust.

People in romantic relationships often share things in common - a love of the same sports team, maybe the same religion, sometimes a common profession. But for some couples, the similarities go further. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The girl that I'm dating now, we have the same birthday, which is kind of cool. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: My fiance, Israel (ph), and I have the same birthday, which is something we discovered on our second date. VEDANTAM: You could say this isn't so surprising. There are lots of people in the world, and sooner or later, some people are going to get together with others who happen to have the same birthday. But there's evidence this may be more than just a coincidence. Having a common birthday seems to actually draw people closer to one another. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When I first went to a new hairstylist, we found out that we have the same birthday, and we call each other birthday twins, and I wound up going to that hair stylist for years, even after she switched salons, even after we moved. I would drive 40 minutes to go get my hair cut by her. VEDANTAM: Some people see so much significance in shared birthdays, or even shared numbers in two birthdays, that they select dates for important events based on those patterns. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: My birthday is August 2, and my husband Blake's (ph) birthday is August 9, and we got married on August 29. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: My wife and I share the same birthday, July 6, and we are also married on that day. JANETTA CRAVENS: My birthday is October 27, and with my first husband, his birthday was September 27, and we had the opportunity to get married on August 27. It was a no-brainer. We decided to do that. VEDANTAM: The woman you just heard, Janetta Cravens (ph) from Oklahoma City, says her love for people with the same birthday extends beyond her love life. CRAVENS: October 27 is also Teddy Roosevelt's birthday, and so I've always felt a little affinity for him and for his leadership. VEDANTAM: Shared birthdays, in fact, aren't the only thing that draw people closer to one another. Janetta also finds herself drawn to people who happen to have the same name. CRAVENS: When I meet another Janetta, there's an automatic like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we have the same name. And then if it happens to be that we have the same spelling - and I'll tell you, I've only met two people who have the same spelling as me, but I can tell you who they are and I felt an automatic kinship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: These unexpected connections with strangers can be lovely moments. But there's something else at work, too, something we may not be aware of, something that affects all of us. In Greek mythology, the hunter Narcissus was so enamored of his own beauty that he fell in love with a reflection of himself. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves, whether that's someone else with the same name or someone with the same birthday. Most of the time, such self-love is amusing and harmless, maybe even beneficial, a sign of good self-esteem. But there are times when falling in love with ourselves or with people who remind us of ourselves can be a real problem. This week on HIDDEN BRAIN - what we are calling the Narcissus Effect. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Researchers have long observed a tendency for people to be drawn to others who are like them in some way. When we hear someone else has the same birthday or the same name, we feel a little tug of kinship. Some of us might even be drawn to move to states that sound familiar. BRETT PELHAM: There's at least a modest tendency for women named Georgia to gravitate toward Georgia, women named Virginia to gravitate toward Virginia, and the more closely the name resembles a state, the bigger the effect appears to be. VEDANTAM: This is Brett Pelham. He's a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland. He studies something called implicit egotism. PELHAM: Which is the idea that many biases are unconscious. And one very well-studied bias was egotism, valuing the self favorably, protecting the self and so forth. And so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect a preference for the self and an attraction to things that resemble the self. VEDANTAM: Like having an affinity for someone with the same birthday or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo of your name. PELHAM: So we originally looked at whether people named Dennis (ph) or Denise (ph) gravitate toward dentistry. But we learned pretty quickly... VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: ...That it's really hard to get data on those things. So you - there aren't great directories of medical professionals. There is a guy named Abel who was able to document, and I was a reviewer on his paper and I... VEDANTAM: So now every time you say this, I'm going to jump in and say a guy named Abel who was able to do something. PELHAM: He was able to do a lot of things. He showed that people whose last name is doctor or whose last name is the word lawyer, the name Lawyer, gravitated toward those two professions. VEDANTAM: There are lots of other examples. Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans, names from the recently released 1940 census, to examine if there were broad patterns, like... PELHAM: Carpenters working in carpentry, bakers working as bakers, butchers working as butchers, miners working as miners, masons working as masons. So we looked at every surname there is - currently, the top 2,000 surnames - that happens to be a career name, and we looked at all of them. There are 11 of them that are pretty common. I just listed a few. And for every single surname in the 1940s census with something like a - I think it was 130 million people - we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a weak tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names. VEDANTAM: So the obvious thing to say, of course, is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be Carpenters is that the name Carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry. And so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both the names and the choices. PELHAM: Quite possibly, but if you do the math, you pretty quickly see it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people. So if you assume that even over 10 generations, there's a 50% chance that you did what your dad did and a 50% chance that he did what his grandfather did, which is probably higher than reality, you're talking about a probability of less than 1 in 1,000 already over 10 generations. In other words, surnames are so old and they change hands, you know, when a woman named Carpenter marries a guy named Farmer, for example, that that's really - it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham has looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security Death Index or state marriage records, databases with information about millions of Americans, and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects. Like, for example, one listener called in to say she and her husband were both born on the 25 day of different months. This isn't as uncommon as you might think. Beyond what you might expect by mere chance... PELHAM: There's about a 7% bias in that direction. So if you should have a thousand people doing that, you have 1,070 people doing that. VEDANTAM: If that doesn't sound like a lot, you're right. You should think of implicit egotism as a tiny, invisible nudge. It won't shape what everyone does all the time, but it does shape what some people do some of the time. It's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples. Brett says that if you really love your birthday, the effect gets even larger. PELHAM: Our operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number. So if you got married on the 13 of the month, you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number 13 as his birthday number. VEDANTAM: Again, Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason. You may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday. He thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our birthdays and have positive associations with them. PELHAM: And so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that. And the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names they don't like that much, and that's their middle names. You know, and the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name is to know when he's really in trouble. And my additional comment is to know if he might be a serial killer someday, right? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PELHAM: So the middle name is not nearly as loved as the first or the last name. People feel very ambivalent about their middle name. VEDANTAM: There can be other reasons for ambivalence. Sometimes we dislike it when another person has the same birthday. If you were born on April 20, you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day, too. Brett finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but is poorly built, you are more likely to hate that product. People dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has their name on it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: As Brett and I were talking, I realized something a little uncomfortable - that I myself had fallen prey to implicit egotism. You know, as you're talking right now, I am realizing something about myself for the very first time. There is - there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankara - my name - and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as Vedanta. And I've always been drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy of Vedanta to be very interesting, and the fact that Shankara taught that philosophy I thought was just charming. But now as I'm listening to you say this, I'm realizing that this could just be implicit egotism. PELHAM: I've read his work very well, and it truly is wonderful. It's brilliant. So I think in this case, you made the objectively good decision. Yeah. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) At the same time, it does make you think, though. PELHAM: Absolutely, yes. VEDANTAM: Has this ever happened to you, Brett? Do you ever think about yourself and how implicit egotism is affecting you? PELHAM: We're getting a little personal here, but I can't resist being a little bit personal. I would say that probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew, his last name is Polan (ph). His mother's last name was Polan. My last name is Pelham. And I entered a relationship with her before I developed this theory (laughter) not after I developed the theory to validate the theory. VEDANTAM: So you're a Pelham and you got into a relationship with a woman named Polan? PELHAM: Polan - and we are very different in most other ways. That's about as much as I'll say about that (laughter). VEDANTAM: Are you saying that the names played some kind of a role? PELHAM: I have to think it did. I have to think - and we were from different backgrounds, different religions. I mean, we're - we come from very different worlds. Yeah, and yet, I was very attracted to her. VEDANTAM: So... PELHAM: And worse yet, she was attracted to me, right? VEDANTAM: Yeah (laughter). So I understand why you would sort of call this charming, and I think if you do this work for a while, there is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see - you understand sort of the choices that human beings make. But I do think there's something disturbing about it because I think there is a very strong sense that I think most of us have. I have the sense, even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last 10 years, I have the sense that my choices are deliberate choices, that I've thought about them. I'm actually making them intentional. I'm making them intentionally. And the idea that you're coming in and telling me that there are these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself, it is a disturbing idea. PELHAM: It is a little bit disturbing. And of course, most people do what you and I do, which is say, well, of course, that applies to the rest of the world, but I in particular would never fall prey to implicit racial bias or implicit egotism. So most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings. But I've become, in the past decade or so, comfortable enough with the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something. I mean, sometimes I have a pretty good idea, but I don't - I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why I do what I do. I mean, there's just too much research - and much of which you've documented and reported on - that show that biases we're completely unaware, nudge us, sometimes powerfully drive us, in very particular directions. So I think I've just kind of let go of it. It was disturbing to me when I first began to study it - disturbing as well as delightful. And now it's become more delightful and less disturbing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So perhaps you're wondering, how does any of this matter? Who cares if people born on the 23 of September marry those born on the 23 of July? Who cares if someone named Betsy Carpenter gravitates towards carpentry? Why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own? PELHAM: It at least raises tough questions about the degree to which we have free will. So I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it in the sense that it suggests that very important decisions have at least a little nudging influence based on things that you're completely unaware of. So if people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number, that's not an objectively great reason to get married. You should get married because you share values. You're both Republicans. You're both rabid Marxists. But learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do, apparently, to some people is - I find it delightful. But some people find it pretty threatening. I don't think that it proves that there's no such thing as free will. But it - to me, it does suggest that we don't always have free will. Sometimes we make a decision for one reason that we've told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on. VEDANTAM: And this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday. In general, we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us. And that can be a big problem. PELHAM: Absolutely. I do a little bit of research on social justice, and that's one of the things that concerns me most, is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us, who speak our language, who speak our idiom, who look like us, who worship like us. And we pay much less attention, sadly, to the problems of people who don't. On the other hand, I think this finding, like any finding in psychology or behavioral economics, can be used for good or evil. And it - the way it works in the real world can be used for good or bad. And so a great example that I perceive as at least a cousin of implicit egotism is a study I think was done by Eliot Smith and colleagues about 10 years ago. He looked at implicit racial bias. And he looked at implicit racial bias as a function of whether a person from a different ethnic group - I think he had whites and African Americans, for example - had simply given you a gentle friendly touch on the shoulder. And if they had given you a friendly, gentle hello-how-are-you touch, that reduced their implicit racial bias. So to me, when another person becomes a part of you, even in a very tiny way - you play intramural basketball with this person. And you didn't like his group. But now that you meet him and he's on your team, suddenly he becomes a part of you. His group becomes a part of you. And your stereotypes get softened and diminished a little bit. VEDANTAM: When we come back, we're going to look at how the Narcissus effect shapes another important part of your life. If you can fall in love with your name or your birthday, can't you also fall in love with your own ideas, your own work? Of course you can. Researchers call this the Ikea effect. DANIEL MOCHON: We come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: We'll also look at the implications this can have for things much bigger and much more complicated than Swedish furniture. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. The actress Amy Poehler once said, Ikea is Swedish for argument. Researcher Daniel Mochon has one explanation for why build-it-yourself furniture can cause so much friction between partners. MOCHON: Imagine that you built a table. Maybe it came out a little bit crooked. Probably your wife or your neighbor would see it for what it is, you know, probably a shoddy piece of workmanship. But to you, that table might seem really great because you're the one who created it. It is the fruit of your labor, and that is really the idea behind the Ikea effect. It is that we come to overvalue the things that we have created ourselves. VEDANTAM: Brett Pelham's research about our preference for people and places that are associated with us made me think about a related idea. The Narcissus effect also shows up in our preference for things that we make ourselves. MOCHON: The way people usually think about Ikea is that Ikea gives you good furniture for a low cost because they offload lots of the costs onto their consumer - the assembly costs. But in fact, we're in a sense challenging that idea and saying that there's actually psychological benefit behind this, that actually people might end up liking their furniture more because they built it. And so it's not so much a cost but a benefit that they get to build their own furniture. VEDANTAM: Daniel and his co-authors did a series of experiments to test this hypothesis. They brought volunteers into the lab and gave them either a Lego car preassembled or gave them Legos and instructions and told the participants to build a car themselves. Then they asked the volunteers, how much would you pay to keep your Lego car? MOCHON: And what we find is that the people who build their own Legos not only are willing to pay more to keep their assembled Legos, but also, when we asked them how proud they are of their own creations, they tend to be prouder of their Legos. And mind you, these are Legos that are designed to 5 to 7-year-olds. But nonetheless, there seems to be some competence, some pride associated with one's creation, even for basic things as building Legos. VEDANTAM: The researchers replicated the study using other products, like Ikea furniture, and the effect was the same. People who spent time and effort building something felt proud of what they had built, fell in love with it and were willing to pay lots of money to keep the things they'd built. From the perspective of a rational economist, this doesn't make much sense. MOCHON: The students might be willing to pay twice as much money to buy the exact same Lego car if they just finished building that Lego car than if the Lego car was given to them prebuilt. VEDANTAM: So why might people value something more after building it themselves compared to buying the same product made by someone else for half the cost? MOCHON: Our hypothesis was that people tend to use products to signal valued identities to both themselves and to others. And we know that an identity that people really care about is showing that they're competent. This is sort of one of the basics of human motivation. And so we hypothesized that people use self-made products as a way to signal competence to both themselves and to others. You know, having just built a table or having just built a bookcase, that bookcase - that's completed products - acts in a sense of a badge of my own personal competence. I completed it. Therefore, I know I'm a competent person. And moreover, I can display this product and signal that identity, this competent identity, to others. And so we hypothesized that it was these feelings of competence associated with the products that led to their increasing valuation. VEDANTAM: To test the theory that people's feelings of competence was behind the Ikea effect, the researchers had some participants think about other qualities they might value in themselves besides competence - things like honesty or intelligence or humor. Basically, the idea was if we make it less important for people to demonstrate competence, do they still overvalue their own creations? MOCHON: So we found that the Ikea effect disappeared when we did that manipulation. So once competence wasn't that important to people, people, our participants, no longer seemed to get much value out of creating their own products, again, suggesting that the reason why we tend to like our own creations is because we use them as a way to signal competence, both to ourselves and to others. VEDANTAM: Here's the flip side of that coin. You can make the Ikea effect stronger by getting people to question their competence. In one experiment, Daniel and his colleagues gave participants math problems to solve before asking them to build an Ikea project. If the problems were difficult, lots of people failed to solve them. Now volunteers became much more likely to want to demonstrate their competence through the Ikea building project. MOCHON: The participants who, at least temporarily, had their sense of competence threatened, who got the very difficult math questions, tended to be more willing to build their own product. So when we surveyed them and asked them, would you prefer to have an Ikea product that comes prebuilt or the exact same product that comes unbuilt and you would build it yourself, those who got difficult math problems and were feeling somewhat incompetent at the time seemed more willing. They were much more likely to want to build the product themselves and therefore, in a sense, restore their sense of competence through this activity. VEDANTAM: I mean, give me the numbers here. I mean, was this a big effect? Was this a small effect? I mean, what happens when people feel bad compared to when they don't feel bad? MOCHON: So what we found is that about a third of the people wanted to build the Ikea bookshelf in the control condition when they weren't made to feel bad. And this number went up to about 60% when they were made to feel bad - so significantly larger number of people wanted to do this. VEDANTAM: The Ikea effect and implicit egotism might seem at first blush to be interesting and amusing but not terribly significant. But the more I thought about this, the more I saw the potential implications. Just as we can be drawn to those who have the same birthday as us or the same name as us, we might also be more inclined to help people who look like us or sound like us or live near us. Let's hear a congressperson who's drafted a particular piece of legislation. Your commitment to that bill might outweigh its importance to the public. Or let's say you're a president who starts a war. After years of investing your time and effort to prosecute that war, you may find it difficult to accept evidence that you made a mistake. It's fine to gaze lovingly in the mirror and to feel invested in our own ideas. But like Narcissus discovered himself, falling in love with our own reflection can come at great peril.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: All of us are surrounded by brands - designer brands. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Calvin Klein's Obsession. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, the smell of it. VEDANTAM: Bargain shopper brands. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: You're going to spend $20 every month on paper towels anyway. You're throwing your money away. The mini ShamWows are for everything, for everyday use. VEDANTAM: Brands for seemingly every demographic slice among us. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILFORD BRIMLEY: Good morning. I'm Wilford Brimley, and I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes about diabetes. Actually, about diabetes... VEDANTAM: Have you ever stopped to ask how brands influence you? Is it the slick advertising, the relatable characters or the story? AMERICUS REED: Lance Armstrong would go out there, you know, with this story of, I beat cancer. And I'm going to put on my gear. I'm going to put on that yellow bracelet. I had about 50 of them. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, the psychology of brands and how we relate to them - how companies create a world view around the products they sell and then get us to make those products a part of who we are. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Americus Reed knows what it feels like to be an outsider, to be surrounded by strangers and to have to figure out how to fit in. Today, he's a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania. But when he was 17, he was the new kid - one of a handful of black students bused to a predominantly white school. He remembers his first day, getting on the bus with the other black kids from faraway neighborhoods. They were scared. REED: But we didn't want to show any weakness. So we kind of waltzed in and walked in with confidence. And I remember the world stopping and everyone looking up and sort of saying, who are those guys? VEDANTAM: He wanted to be accepted. So he came up with a plan - he would become a social chameleon. REED: I sort of settled on this idea that I would try to be what was almost like a boundary spanner. So I hung out with the nerds. I hung out with the jocks. I hung out with the musicians. I hung out with all different groups. And in that sort of social chameleon, as I would sort of go from group to group, I would try to kind of fit in in a way that allowed me to have some kind of affiliation with that group. VEDANTAM: As he spent time with these different cliques, he noticed that each had its own set of badges, its own language. And he realized that if he could speak that language, adopt those badges, he would start to blend in. So he started buying stuff. He started wearing the things the other kids wore. Often it was about shoes. With the athletes, he wore Nikes. With the musicians - Chuck Taylors. With the hip-hop kids - Adidas, but without the shoelaces. They were like costumes, only deeper. REED: A brand can communicate something. How you wear your pants can communicate something. The particular sort of portfolio of colors that you choose to adorn yourself with can communicate something. VEDANTAM: Americus understood that personal brands are like flags; they tell the world who you are or who you want to be. They telegraph, I'm the smart kid, I'm the rich kid, I'm the athlete. They're a form of self-expression. REED: A brand is so much more than a tagline or a logo; it is more of a meaning system. And so a brand is kind of a promise to deliver on those values and to connect consumers who might have, in their minds, a sense of synchronicity with what they believe those values are. VEDANTAM: We'll talk more in the second half of our conversation about the psychology of brands or the link between brands and behavior, but I want to start by looking at some examples of what you're talking about, Americus. There are people who say, look - brands don't matter, as you said. I just buy what's functional. And then there are people like these characters from the CBC TV show \"Kim's Convenience.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"KIM'S CONVENIENCE\") SIMU LIU: (As Jung) What are you doing? ANDREW PHUNG: (As Kimchee) Oh, these shoes don't play basketball. LIU: (As Jung) They're basketball shoes. You can tell by the little man playing basketball on them. PHUNG: (As Kimchee) No, your shoes are basketball shoes; my shoes are collector's items, and I intend to keep them that way. LIU: (As Jung) Ah, guess it'd be bad if you got some burrito juice on them sneaks (ph), huh? PHUNG: (As Kimchee) Get that burrito away from me. LIU: (As Jung) Get your shoes away from my special edition burrito. PHUNG: (As Kimchee) Dude, I'm not joking. These shoes, they're my legacy. REED: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So talk to me, Americus, about what's going on here. How can a pair of shoes feel like a legacy? REED: I think that it's very interesting, Shankar, because a pair of shoes, if positioned the right way, can encapsulate a story. And that story might be, for example, a story about success or a story about overcoming the odds or a story about being able to have a kind of level of greatness that you would not be able to have but for the shoes. And so when Michael Jordan puts his shoes out there, there is the idea that - it is very clear, right? So it says, be like Mike. What does that mean? It literally means that if I wear these shoes, I will sort of encapsulate some of that mystique because I am wearing the shoes as well. And so it's a very powerful way that a brand can tell a story that can connect with a person's or a consumer's sense of identity, that can then create this sense of legacy that the individual in the clip was referring to. VEDANTAM: So when you think about brands in the way that you're describing them - not as tags or even as just as names or commercial, a way to sort of commercially identify a product, but really as stories, as narratives - how valuable are these stories, commercially speaking? REED: Oh, they're tremendously valuable. And the reason that they're valuable is because they create a kind of impervious connection that's hard to break. If a consumer connects with a brand or a product in terms of an identity argument instead of an argument about how better the features are of the product compared to something else they could buy, then what is happening is that there is an insulation from the brand's competitive attacks because once a person believes that a brand is part of who they are, then asking them to go to another brand is essentially asking them to change who they are. And that is an incredibly powerful psychological gravitational pull that is really hard to overcome. And that value in terms of customer lifetime value is a real, like, economic entity because it literally means that the person is going to be onboard and be buying for a very long time and be willing to do your own marketing basically for free because they are advocates of the brand. They are what we refer to as brand evangelists because they are now willing to go out there and protect the brand. So that value is massive in terms of creating this type of connection that can last with consumers for a very long time. VEDANTAM: You've used a technique called social listening to study the fans of a very iconic brand, the tech company Apple. What is this technique and what do you observe among Apple fans? REED: This technique called social listening is a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning, where we literally go out into the Internet and we identify conversations that people are having online about brands. And what we particularly find with Apple is that there is a special, unique kind of conversation quality that happens between very fiercely loyal Apple users, and they talk about the brand in a fascinating way. There is language about the brand that almost feels as if the individual consumer is talking about religion or politics. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: There is a kind of fierce, very powerful, emotional way that consumers talk about the Apple brand. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: So today I'm going to be showing you all of the Apple products that I own, from old to new, everything that I own from Apple. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Something else - portrait mode. Oh, my God, I'm literally obsessed with portrait mode. Like... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Just because I mentioned that I have an Apple tattoo on my arm. And I wouldn't say I would get it again. I was 100% Apple obsessed. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Oh, yeah. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Like, I would say 75% of the conversations that I had ended up talking about Apple in some way. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) REED: And so Apple has been very good at creating this kind of emotional connection, such that consumers, once they're on board, Apple can basically say, hey, we would like for you to buy a new charger, which is kind of absurd. But consumers are like, sure, I'll do that. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: Because they are so bought in. Whereas, you know, they could go to Android, and they could not have to ever deal with buying new chargers, et cetera, et cetera. But they're willing to do it. They're willing to stand outside in the cold, Shankar, in a line. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: And wait for hours and hours and commiserate with fellow Apple loyalists to get that shiny new thing in the box. They don't have to do that. There's something that is not rational about this, and it's reflected when we look at and analyze the text of conversations that occur between these fiercely loyal Apple folks. VEDANTAM: Now, Apple fans might say they are not deluded about their gizmos; they might argue that Apple products are objectively better than other tech products. But Americus points out that you see the same brand loyalty when two products are objectively identical. REED: The example that I always use in my class is a very simple example of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals - the Walmart or the Walgreens brand versus Tylenol. And the fact that you can have a product that is essentially identical in terms of its active ingredients, but yet one will cost 27% more in the store. And people know that the Walgreens brand is the same thing as the Tylenol brand. And that entire market for Tylenol actually shouldn't exist if people are rational. But what it says is, there's something else above and beyond the features that has utility. VEDANTAM: You can also see the power of brand loyalty in sports. Americus has spent a lot of time analyzing fans of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. People like Patrick Moeller, who demonstrates his commitment to the Eagles with a massive RV plastered with the team mascot and logo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Eagle One is Patrick Moeller's $300,000 homage to his beloved Philadelphia Eagles. PATRICK MOELLER: I'm sure there's not any Eagle fan that has been more to games than I have in the last six years. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Since 2006, this eagle has nested at every single game - home and away. REED: Wow (laughter). VEDANTAM: Talk about this, Americus - how do people like Moeller go from being consumers of a product to effectively being ambassadors of the product? REED: The Eagles are intricately connected with the city of Philadelphia - right? - the scrappy, gritty city of Philadelphia, the underdog Philadelphia, the blue collar Philadelphia. And for Patrick, you know, living those values and going to those games and being there when the team is awful and wanting to, like, represent your city through the sport, through the Eagles, is something that's a special kind of characteristic, especially in this city, of those fans that are Philly sports fans. And so for Patrick, he essentially immersed himself into this identity and almost lost himself. His identity, I would say, Shankar, is completely fused with being an Eagles fan. He's literally taken this beautiful RV, and he's gone to all of the games since 2006. I mean, think about - well, you've got to have a lot of time on your hands - but think about the commitment. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: Think about the loyalty to do this and to create an image and a spectacle. And the Philadelphia Eagles, if you're a brand, you're like, oh, my God, how do I clone Moellers of the world, right? How do I get all these fans to get so excited that they'll put the tattoo on their body. They'll - how do I get people to do that, to be my sort of walking billboard, my one-man, one-woman marketing department for free? And this is beautiful because it points to the fact that if you can kind of do what the Eagles did, with respect to keeping consistent and authentic with their story, you can create these types of fans, draw them in and reinforce what they want to try to express to others. And so, you know, promoting him and sort of bring him to the forefront for the Eagles franchise and football team is a genius thing to do because you're literally just piggybacking on the fact that you've got a hardcore evangelist that is so wrapped up in your brand that he's willing to do these things to advocate on your behalf. VEDANTAM: So if you have companies that actually want to create these brands from scratch, to build them up from the ground - you know, lots of companies now recognize, of course, that this is a powerful thing to do, so lots of companies want in on this. Here's a clip from Ellen DeGeneres about one company's efforts to create a distinctive brand. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW\") ELLEN DEGENERES: It's a new product from Bic, the pen company. And they have a new line of pens called Bic For Her. (LAUGHTER) DEGENERES: And this is totally real. They're pens just for ladies. I know what you're thinking - it's about damn time. Where have our pens been? (LAUGHTER) DEGENERES: Can you believe this? We've been using man pens all these years. Yuck (ph). REED: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: So what went wrong here, Americus? Why did this ad campaign fall flat compared to the stuff that Apple does? REED: The answer is when a company is trying to hone in on a specific identity, to make a connection, a relevant connection to its brand, it has to understand that identity in a almost sociological way. And in the case of Bic For Her, I think it's quite clear that the correlation between gender and buying pens is zero. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: And so if you try to tell a story that says, these are the pens for women, then the - if you don't get immediately thrown out of the building, the question will be, OK, tell me why these - why are these pens, quote, \"for women\"? And I think in the specific case of Bic For Her, there was not - there was nothing underneath the hood, so to speak, Shankar; it was just kind of, like, perceived as this gimmick. We call this, by the way, Shankar, in the marketing and business world, when you do not know how to market to women, we call it shrink it and pink it. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: And it's like - it's a huge mistake because you didn't bother to try to understand women. That's very clear. And in fact, you went the opposite way in telling a story that would almost be perceived as insulting to women, like taking the feminist movement backwards in terms of identity because it's like, well, wait a minute - we don't need our - the pen for women. And so because you didn't understand that identity, and you didn't take it seriously, you didn't study it, you didn't sociologically unpack it and analyze it and try to understand its connection to that specific decision-making process, you make dumb mistakes like how Bic made. VEDANTAM: I want to talk a moment about a nonbusiness, nonconsumer setting. Republicans and Democrats don't think about their political parties as brands, but it sounds like they almost relate to them in the way people relate to brands. And I'm wondering, is the animosity we see in the country between Republicans and Democrats less to do with ideology and more about brand loyalty? REED: Political parties are indeed brands. And what we're witnessing today, right now, is the almost perverse, extreme aspect of when identity and identity loyalty and identity connection goes way off the rails. And so the notion that political parties are now becoming tribes is very, very clear and making connections to their identity, right? So if you have a proposition to say, I would like to build a wall to help with immigration, you can make a functional argument about a wall. Or you can do what Republicans did, which is to make an identity argument to say, that wall represents keeping some group of individuals out that we don't want in this country for lots of different reasons. That's an identity argument. That's an in-group, out-group argument. That's an emotional argument. And so on. On the other side, the other side says, this wall now represents something that is antithetical to how they see themselves. It represents oppression, discrimination. It represents all things evil. So there's no way the two can have a conversation about trying to settle on the issue on how to move forward with a policy around that wall because the wall now has become a symbol of identity. It's all about your tribe. It's all about the values that you are trying to protect, that you believe that you're trying to protect, as they are encapsulated in your particular political brand. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, what happens when your favorite brand breaks your heart? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When Americus Reed was in his early 40s, a doctor told him that his knees were in bad shape. He needed to give up basketball and running. So he started to look for another sport that would be easier on his joints. REED: I got into cycling and found the sport and fell in love with the culture immediately. And like a lot of people, I connected with the Lance Armstrong brand. And actually, Lance Armstrong plus Nike plus Americus equaled something that was so aspirational in my mind. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL SHERWEN: Armstrong is a man who rides on courage and guts. If his teammate can't... REED: Lance brought me into the world of professional cycling in terms of actually watching it, watching the Tour de France. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL LIGGETT: What a performance by Lance Armstrong this has been now as he drives up to the line. REED: And I fell in love with Lance because his story, Shankar, his story of, I beat cancer. And I'm going to put on my gear. I'm going to put on that yellow bracelet. I had about 50 of them. And the jersey, the shoe warmups - everything. And I would go - I was - I bought the bike that he used, and I would be out there, and I would be channeling Lance Armstrong. I would think about Lance Armstrong in the mountains. And it was, for me, deeply emotional. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIGGETT: Armstrong rocks and rolls his way here now. As he comes up to the line, his time is 15:01 (ph). He wins the time trial. REED: And when little whisperings came out that, well, wait a minute - people are accusing Lance Armstrong of cheating, I was the first to say, you're wrong. No way. This is not happening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: ...Has just announced moments ago it will ban Armstrong for life and strip him of his seven Tour titles. REED: And it was heartbreaking from the perspective of my identity because what happened was I lost a part of myself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) REED: And when it came out that Lance Armstrong is a fraud, Lance Armstrong is a charlatan, I literally remember the day that I went and got all of my Livestrong and Lance Armstrong gear, and I put it in a bag, and I set it outside. It was this - it was almost like a funeral, Shankar. It was like - it was a moment of grieving because this iconic, aspirational self turned out to be a shallow and hollow fraud. And I felt foolish. I felt like I was a fool in that relationship with his brand because I was trying to reinforce and express all of these values that turned out not to be true. VEDANTAM: It's so interesting, isn't it? Because at one level, Lance Armstrong doing well, him beating cancer, him winning the Tour de France, really has nothing to do with you. REED: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And his cheating and his doping also has nothing to do with you. And yet you, you know, triumphed when he triumphed, and you grieved when he fell. REED: That's - you're touching on something I think is the key premise of identity connections between consumers and brands, Shankar. And that's the idea that's like, once my identity fused with that, I was in sync with his highs and lows. And the idea that even though his performance, his approach had nothing to do with me, I was using that story not only on the bike in a literal sense but also kind of in my life in a figurative sense, in the sense that I would almost think about and mentally represent Lance on the bike when I was faced with a challenge in my professional life or in my personal life. And I used that energy, that motivational impetus, that's coming from the brand, that's haloing off the brand, that I'm consuming from the brand. I'm using that for me as a source of energy that allows me to push through, to soldier on. And all of those different values that are associated with, you know, the idea that I'm putting in the work on the bike. I'm diligent. I believe. I believe in myself. I'm going to work hard, and I'm going to overcome great obstacles. And so even though it had nothing to do with me, I was drawing upon that energy. And when I found out that the energy was actually poisoned, then it sort of resulted in this deep sense of loss for me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: You conducted a study with Amit Bhattacharjee and Jonathan Berman - how we sometimes decouple problematic aspects of a brand with the things that we admire about the brand. If Lance Armstrong had been caught stealing rather than doping, I'm wondering if you could have decoupled your admiration for Lance Armstrong the athlete with your distaste. Was the fact that the unethical behavior was in the same domain as his accomplishment that made them difficult to disentangle? REED: In the paper that you reference there, we refer to this notion that you're talking about as moral decoupling. And so it's based on the fundamental premise that if there is an individual that you have a natural inclination to want to support, then what we know about psychology is that humans will figure out ways to rationalize the support for that individual that they want to support to uphold a belief that they want to have. And so they will try to interpret the world around them in ways that allow them to uphold those beliefs. So for example, let's take the example of Tiger Woods, who recently came back after a long layoff of a lot of tragedy and challenge, both physically, professionally and personally. If you look at his story, what did he do? Well, he cheated on his wife. And so cheating on your wife presumably has nothing to do with your golf game. So if you desired to support Tiger Woods, you could make the mental argument in your mind that would reflect moral decoupling. You could say, well, you know, I don't really agree with this whole thing that he might have been doing in his personal life. However, I really like his golf game, so I'm going to continue to support him. And so what's interesting about moral decoupling - if that bad thing that the celebrity or the person does is not related to the performance that you admire, then you can pull it apart in your mind, and you can almost ignore, if you will, or not even comment on the morality of the bad thing because you can simply focus on the performance and the fact that you admire what they do in that performance domain. And so it's a very interesting aspect because in the case of Lance Armstrong, it was impossible for me. And I'm going to tell you the truth - Lord knows I tried. (LAUGHTER) REED: But it was impossible for me to pull those two things apart for Lance Armstrong, and that's why all of his clothes ended up on my sidewalk (laughter), so. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now, there are lots of people, Americus, who think that the idea of building a brand is just distasteful; it's just marketers and big companies trying to hoodwink customers, hoodwink consumers. Frank Germann, Aaron Garvey and Lisa Bolton once conducted an interesting study involving Nike putters. And when I spoke with Frank Germann, here's how he explained the study to me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) FRANK GERMANN: About half of the participants were told that they would be putting with a Nike putter, whereas the other half of participants were not told what putter brand they would be using. Importantly, all participants used the exact same putter. And, you know, interestingly, our results showed that those who thought that it was a Nike putter on average needed significantly fewer putts to sink the golf ball. VEDANTAM: What's going on here, Americus? In some ways, this is connected to what you were telling me about wearing your Lance Armstrong gear and biking and feeling like you were doing better. But this actually suggests this isn't just a feeling; you actually might have biked better when you were wearing your Lance Armstrong gear. REED: What it literally shows is the placebo effect, which is what they are really tapping into here, is real. You have been told about \"Just Do It\" for so long you believe that that brand endows a performance advantage, so much so that the psychological perceptions of that brand literally translate in your ability to actually perform, to make those putts in fewer strokes. And that, to me, is the most salient and powerful example of this notion that the power of brand is so intertwined with the perceived expectations of the behavioral activities that are built into that narrative or that story about the brand that they literally translate into advantages for the brand that really shouldn't be there, for all intents and purposes. I wish someone would have put the metrics on me and done the controlled experiment, where I didn't know it, double-blind, where I would be on my bike with and without the Lance Armstrong clothes and see. Because I would be willing to bet - I remember days going out and riding the bike - I remember this one time where I was trying to go up this one hill, and I was struggling. I looked down, and I could see my Livestrong band on my wrist. And I looked down, and I unzipped my bike jersey, like Lance does. This is something Lance used to do when he was about to get serious. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). REED: He would unzip his jersey, and he'd take his cap and he'd flip it around. And it's like, this means that he's signaling to his competitors, I'm about to get very, very, like, hardcore into this, and I'm about to take this to a whole new level. I remember doing that, and I remember powering through this hill and getting to the top and, like, imagining in my mind those fans of Lance... (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) REED: ...That would be at the top of the hill cheering him on. And I almost - I'm willing to bet that my performance improved when I was wearing his gear. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: You've talked in the past about how branding can be a force for good, that it can help companies that are mission-driven companies accomplish great things. But I'm wondering if you can also talk a little bit about this challenge that branding has. A lot of people see it as manipulative, see it as inauthentic. Does branding have a branding problem? REED: (Laughter) That's fantastic. I love that question, Shankar. The answer is yes. And it's unfortunate because branding in and of itself is neither inherently good or bad. So it's kind of like - the analogy that I like to use when I'm talking about this is that, you know, branding and marketing more generally is like a hammer. And so you can take a hammer, and if you want to, you can build a house for a homeless person, right? But you can also take a hammer, and if you want to, knock an elderly person upside their head and take their wallet. There's nothing inherently bad about a hammer; it's how you use it. And why not use it as a force for change, as something powerful and positive? For example, if you are a brand that is a sports company, isn't it great that you can actually become the motivational impetus for a consumer to want to exercise more and to make themselves healthier for themselves and their loved ones? Isn't that a good thing? I think that's a good thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Americus Reed is a psychologist and professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Americus, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. REED: Thank you so much, Shankar. It was a pleasure to be with you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Angus Chen and Laura Kwerel. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Jenny Schmidt, Parth Shah and Thomas Lu. Our unsung hero this week is Juana Merlo. Until recently, Juana worked at NPR's marketing department. She helped divide up our visual identity by designing the HIDDEN BRAIN logo. As a journalist, I thought a lot about stories and writing and editing but hadn't given much thought to visual design. Juana set me right on that, and she helped come up with a visual identity that travels with our show on social media and at live events. Thanks, Juana. If you enjoy HIDDEN BRAIN and want to hear more of our work, maybe as you're powering through a tough bike ride, be sure to subscribe to this podcast. If you know someone who would like to listen to this episode, please be sure to share it with them. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

        "title": "Are Some People Better At Recognizing Faces?  : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. If you're like me, you know this feeling. Maybe you're at a party or you're walking down the street and suddenly, out of a sea of passing faces, one of them lights up looking right at you. This person starts waving, says hello. This person is glad to see you. And you? You have no idea who you're looking at. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Today on the show, we're talking about faces. Recognizing faces is a crucial skill. It's so crucial that there are regions of the brain devoted to facial recognition. But although your mind is amazing at identifying your boyfriend or your child in a crowd, there are important limits to this ability. Some of us, like me, are extremely bad at it. Some of us are terrific. On today's show, we look at some people who are on opposite ends of the spectrum and talk about how our ability to recognize faces has broad implications in our lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We'll start with someone whose job requires her to be quick with faces. She's a cop. ALISON YOUNG: My name's Alison Young, and I'm a police officer in the Metropolitan Police in London. VEDANTAM: She started out several years ago working on response teams in east London. These are the cops who mostly just respond to 911 calls. Then about 3 1/2 years into that job, she and a bunch of her fellow officers were invited to take a series of tests at a university. YOUNG: You get given, like, three or four different faces and you have to memorize those faces. VEDANTAM: Then a new screen appears with other faces. These ones are obscured in some way or heavily pixilated. One of the faces you saw earlier might now show up wearing a beard. YOUNG: So you have to try and work out which one of the faces is a face that you've seen before. And it's that kind of thing. VEDANTAM: The test, of course, was measuring how good officers were at recognizing faces. A while later, Alison received her results. She came in second out of all the officers. YOUNG: And they asked me to come down to Scotland Yard. VEDANTAM: Scotland Yard, of course, is the headquarters for London police. When she got there, she was told she was being added to a new unit they were forming. It was called the super-recognizer unit. YOUNG: Yes, that's what - that's the name that they've given (laughter). VEDANTAM: Do you feel like a super-recognizer? YOUNG: I don't know. I don't - well, I guess so, but I don't think I'd necessarily say that a lot because it's just the word super, isn't it? It sounds a bit super. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). YOUNG: It's just - I don't know, it's just the notion of the word super kind of brings out as if we're some sort of superhero or something like that, whereas that isn't the case. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Here's how the super-recognizer unit works. This pool of cops with above-average abilities to recognize faces sits in front of computers. They have faces of criminal suspects shown to them and they try, in essence, to play a matching game. YOUNG: Well, there's a catalog of criminals, essentially, that are wanted by police. And what they decided to develop was a thing called snapping, which meant that we may not know who that person is, but if I look at this face - No. 1 photo on this chart - and then I continue to go through further and further and further through different photos, can I find him in any other photos that he's wanted for? Which then means that we've got him for one offense of - I don't know - theft. We find him for another offense to do with theft, and you end up accruing this one person for around 25 to 30 different crimes. VEDANTAM: Now, computers are getting better at this kind of task. And maybe one day algorithms will come to replace human beings in making these kinds of matches for police. But for now, Scotland Yard decided to put its faith in humans like Alison. That's because there are some things that humans can do that computers can't. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Last year, for example, the transit police came to Scotland Yard for help. A 21-year-old woman and two girls aged 15 and 16 complained that a man had inappropriately touched them while riding the bus. Transit police pulled security footage taken from the various buses. From the pictures and the witness accounts, it appeared his modus operandi was to get on the bus with a newspaper. He would sit next to the young woman and then attempt to fondle her under cover of the newspaper. YOUNG: And they were overtly young, in the respect that some of them were in school uniforms. VEDANTAM: The security footage was grainy. The transit police didn't have an ID on the man. And because he struck at different times on different buses, they didn't know how to track him down. YOUNG: And they basically had said to us, we need to find this man. It's young girls, it's predatory, et cetera. So myself and my colleague, Detective Sergeant Eliot Porritt, just, like, did some investigation. VEDANTAM: They studied the security videos and eventually they figured out which station the man tended to frequent. YOUNG: After a lot of investigation, we discovered that he had quite a specific route of generally being around Camden Town, which is an area in northwest London. VEDANTAM: Camden Town is a busy neighborhood. It's heavily populated, with lots of shops and tourists and people always milling about. It's perfect, in other words, for someone to blend into the background. Alison and Eliot Porritt knew what they had to do. YOUNG: So we made our way to Camden Town from Scotland Yard on a Wednesday. I can't remember the exact date, but I know it was a Wednesday. VEDANTAM: This was supposed to be just a scouting mission to get a sense of the Camden Town bus station. Alison and her partner decided to look through old security footage in the CCTV room. YOUNG: So we went to the CCTV bit, which was just behind a clear Perspex glass where people buy their tickets. So it's right by the entrance foyer to the station. VEDANTAM: Detective Porritt began talking with the transit security. Alison was looking through the glass at the commuters milling about the station. YOUNG: I just glanced up and through the crowd I just saw him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) YOUNG: I saw him walk in, pick up a newspaper and leave or go to leave. And at which point, I - I mean, I screamed because - I don't know why I did it, I just screamed (laughter). I don't know, I can't quite work out why but I just made quite a loud noise and just said to Sergeant Porritt, he's outside. VEDANTAM: They both stopped what they were doing and rushed to catch up with the man. YOUNG: But it was quite difficult to get out because we had to go all the way back round, back round to the foyer. So by the time we'd got into the main foyer where he was, we couldn't see him anymore. VEDANTAM: They ran out of the station to see if he'd left. They looked left, couldn't see him. They looked right, Alison caught a quick glimpse of a man disappearing around a corner. This fraction of a second was all she needed to recognize her target. The cops started running toward the corner. YOUNG: And as we turned, we looked just behind the wall. He was there. VEDANTAM: The officers approached the man. YOUNG: Soon as we got up to him, as in face to face with him, the pair of us - myself, Detective Sergeant Porritt - we were a 100,000,000% certain that this is the exact same gentleman in all the photos. So he was taken in handcuffs immediately and explained to him what he was being arrested for, et cetera. And it was extremely noticeable that he was very nervous. His mouth just went completely dry. And he just wasn't able to speak. VEDANTAM: The man was recently sentenced to prison and is suspended from using London's public transit after he's released. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Alison Young no longer works on the super-recognizer unit. She's gone on to other detective work. But she says the time she spent on this unusual unit was the first she ever realized she had an above-average ability. The thing is, she's still not sure where the skill comes from. YOUNG: Yeah. I think my mom was just always, oh, you got that from me - modest as ever, my mother. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). YOUNG: But my mommy's very, very, very good with faces - very good. We would be walking just doing some shopping and she would see someone and go and speak to them. And she'd have known them from primary school and she'll remember them. And my mom's - what is she now, 61? And she went to primary school at, like, 7 or 8 with them and she'll remember them. VEDANTAM: So do you think this is genetic or do you think this is learned? YOUNG: I have no - I don't think it's learned, I don't. I don't think you could teach someone. I don't think you could teach someone to be able to just do it at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Coming up, how common is Alison's skill? Are you a super-recognizer? Can you learn to be one? That and more from a scientist who studies how we identify faces. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. So the other week, I was at the airport, and just like everyone else, I showed my driver's license to get past security. And it occurred to me that I was operating on an assumption that I think is widely shared. I assume the TSA officer was pretty good at matching my face with the photo on my driver's license. So I asked Mike Burton - he's a professor of psychology at the University of York in the United Kingdom - if that assumption was true. MIKE BURTON: It's not, although it is a very common assumption. Most of us think we're pretty good at recognizing faces. But when you actually test people out, particularly in this situation where somebody who doesn't know you is checking a photo against you, it turns out people are really bad at this. Interestingly, even professionals are really bad at it. So we did some work with passport officers last year, where we showed that even passport officers find this a very difficult task and are often inaccurate. VEDANTAM: When I showed my ID at the airport last week, Mike, I handed over the ID and I noticed that the officer looked at the ID first and then looked at my face second. And I assume there must be some trick to this, that it actually is - you're able to make a better connection if you don't actually look at the person's face, that you start with the ID and then look at the face. Is there any truth to that? BURTON: No. There's all kinds of techniques that the people who do this professionally use. And what's interesting is they all believe themselves to be performing quite well. But when you test them, just like anybody else, they're actually not very accurate at this. VEDANTAM: It's a little terrifying what you're telling me because you're saying that this thing that we're relying on to keep ourselves safe to run security systems at airports and other places, that this is a fundamentally bad system? BURTON: That is exactly what I'm telling you. I think that what's sort of interesting is that we have come to rely on this, but I think we've come to rely on it for an interesting reason. We are fantastic at recognizing faces, those faces of people we know. We can recognize our family and friends across a huge range of conditions, you know, at distances, in bad light, all kinds. But we falsely assume that this means we're quite good at faces in general and, in fact, we're not. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Mike can say all this with some degree of confidence because he ran a study to test for it. BURTON: So we set up this little experiment where we asked people to match pairs of faces. They just have to say, are these two faces the same person or not? VEDANTAM: Mike and his colleagues ran this experiment in both the United Kingdom and in Australia. In both countries, they selected some faces that were likely to be well-known locally but unlikely to be known globally. BURTON: Yes, we use what we call B-list celebrities. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). BURTON: So we check it out beforehand, but we use people who are known very well by our - by the local population. These are people like, you know, news readers, local sports people. And they tend to be very well known by the local community but not by people internationally. What we find then is that when the U.K. people are matching U.K. celebrities, they're really good at it. And they're really poor at matching the Australian celebrities, the people that they don't know. When you look at the Australian students looking at these photos, you find exactly the opposite pattern. They're great at matching Australian celebrities and poor at matching U.K. celebrities. So at this point, we know that there's nothing in the faces themselves that make them easy or hard to match. It's just in the perceptions of the viewers. So far so good, we know that people are better at matching familiar faces. But what we then ask is, how well do you think other people will do on these faces when we give them the same task? And what you find is that the U.K. viewers think other people will find the U.K. faces easier. The Australian viewers think other people will find the Australian photos easier. That can't both be true. It must be that they are falsely generalizing their own knowledge to other people. VEDANTAM: You make a very interesting point in the paper, and I was struck by it, which is that in some ways, this might be part of a general phenomenon in cognition where we do not fully understand how difficult a task is for someone else to do. And especially when we are good at something, it's very, very difficult for us to anticipate how much harder it could be for somebody else to do the very same task. BURTON: That's right. It's - it comes up in a number of areas of psychology, even something simple like general knowledge. If you happen to have read some books about Napoleon and be knowledgeable about Napoleon, you falsely generalize that and assume that other people know more about Napoleon than they actually do. Of course, we all have our own different areas of specialist knowledge. And people turn out to be rather poor at understanding that and being able to generalize it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC VEDANTAM: I'm wondering how good you are at facial recognition? BURTON: I'm poor. On the tests, I'm just a little below average. VEDANTAM: And has doing these tests and studying this, has it sort of changed the way you yourself trust yourself or your ability to recognize faces? BURTON: Well, I do now know how poor I am. I certainly would try not to rely on my own ability to do it. But I think that nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces. And it's just becoming clear now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Our chronic inability to recognize faces, coupled with our chronic overconfidence in our ability to recognize faces, has big consequences. One place that's especially true is in the criminal justice system where eyewitness identifications are often central to police investigations. But this issue also shows up in lots of other settings with lower stakes - recognizing colleagues at an office party or a fellow parent at a school meeting. Julie Doerschlag from Washington, D.C., has had this problem for a long time. JULIE DOERSCHLAG: I've had a lot of uncomfortable situations - forgetting people and have been accused of being a snob or racist or, I mean, everything. VEDANTAM: If Alison Young - the cop we heard from earlier - was a super-recognizer, you might call Julie face blind. Her whole life, she's been terrible with faces. J DOERSCHLAG: When I was in college, I - you know, you're on a campus, you meet a lot of people all the time. And there were people I met for a few minutes at a party or something, a meeting, I don't know. And I'd be on campus - small campus - walking and I'd walk past them, didn't think anything of it, just smile and keep going. And they were offended. I've heard over time, people were offended. I got this little reputation of being this snobby person because I didn't greet everybody that I met or how are you doing or - so - and I normally would if I knew them or thought I knew them. VEDANTAM: Julie's struggles followed her as she left college and entered the working world. J DOERSCHLAG: I worked for an architecture firm in Philadelphia, and we had to go to a meeting. And I swore after going into the meeting and then coming back - going back into the meeting room, I talked to this guy as if I knew him. He happened to be African-American and I was talking to him. He's like, I'm not that man. I said, oh, I'm sorry, I could have sworn. He's like, oh, OK. So it became that. And it's not people of just color or different ethnicity. VEDANTAM: What do you do about it? J DOERSCHLAG: I apologize profusely and usually the people just walk away from me (laughter). So I just stop - I just feel - I'm just used to being embarrassed. VEDANTAM: Research suggests, by the way, that people are worse at recognizing faces of people from unfamiliar groups. Many Americans are worse at recognizing the face of someone from a different race than a face of someone from their own race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now what makes Julie's dilemma especially acute is her husband, Marty. MARTY DOERSCHLAG: When I look at somebody, I never forget their face. If I spend about 30 seconds looking at somebody, I will remember their face for years and years and years. VEDANTAM: Marty Doerschlag, Julie's husband, is a super-recognizer. For years, Julie's been keenly aware of her husband's super power. One time, they were in Las Vegas sitting down for dinner at a restaurant. Marty glanced up at the waiter. J DOERSCHLAG: He's like, oh, you waited on me in Columbus, Ohio, in X year. The guy just froze. And then he's like, oh, yeah. And you - and I don't know how you put it together. You named the restaurant, the time, the place. And it was probably 15 years before. And he said, yeah, you're right. And so he does it a lot with servers. And, you know, I think people in the restaurant industry travel, and he remembers them because they're servers. You see their face. VEDANTAM: Marty's had lots of encounters like this. Like at the Dallas airport, he spotted a man he sat behind at a University of Michigan football game three years earlier. Now, you might think that with this gift, Marty could at least be Julie's crutch, but it doesn't always work out like that. M DOERSCHLAG: If we're in a place, I'll always - sometimes - and I'll whisper in the back of her ear, that's Jim, you know, who works at so-and-so. J DOERSCHLAG: Well, sometimes he doesn't catch me in time. I think we were at one of your friend's apartments. A guy came in and I went up and hugged him and said, oh, it's so good to see you again. And Marty's friend leaned over and said, why is Julie hugging the caterer? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) J DOERSCHLAG: So... M DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. J DOERSCHLAG: Yeah. M DOERSCHLAG: I remember that, too. And I... J DOERSCHLAG: But they let that one go 'cause they thought that was funny. M DOERSCHLAG: But I saw it coming, too. I saw Julie approaching the guy. And I said to my friend, I said, watch, she's going to think that's your roommate... VEDANTAM: (Laughter). M DOERSCHLAG: ...Because they look sort of - they look - I mean, they had the same color hair, I think, or something. And they were the same size. And I said to him, here it comes, watch. And sure enough, she did it. It was... J DOERSCHLAG: But I touched him. I hugged him. So that goes into another - you have to be careful. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Julie's cringeworthy ordeals hit close to home. Recently, I was watching a play. The lead actor looked familiar. I stared at his face for the better part of 90 minutes. But it took me until after the play was over to realize this was a colleague of mine from NPR. I'd be absolutely terrible as a TSA agent. And it got me wondering, are there any solutions here? Julie's picked a simple one. J DOERSCHLAG: I don't approach people with as much joie de vivre. I don't touch them until I'm sure they want to be touched (laughter) and - or that I know them. And also I sort of create this verbal cue for them to tell me why I know them. So if I shake their hand I'll say, oh, right, do I know you from somewhere? And they're like - if they say, I don't think so, I said, OK, you just looked a little familiar. I'd rather err on that side than not knowing them. And if they finish the sentence, I said, yes, that's right. Good to see you again. But I don't use again until now that they've filled in the blank. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: For many thousands of years, humans lived in small, nomadic groups. Everyone probably knew everyone else. People didn't have the information overload we have today. You and I can come into contact with hundreds, thousands of people in a single day. Our minds simply haven't evolved at the same speed as our societies. There are going to be outliers among us, people with extraordinary skill at recognizing faces. Some of them may end up as security officers or gregarious socialites or politicians. The rest of us are going to keep smiling awkwardly at office parties at people we're supposed to know. It's what happens when you stumble around in the 21st century with a mind that was designed in the Stone Age. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's show was produced by Chris Benderev and edited by Jenny Schmidt. Our supervising producer is Tara Boyle. Our team includes Renee Cohen, Parth Shah, Laura Kwerel, Thomas Lu and Angus Chen. Our unsung hero this week is Alexander Diaz, who troubleshoots technical problems whenever they arise and has the most unflappable, kind disposition in the face of whatever crisis we throw his way. Producers at NPR have taken to calling him Batman because he's constantly, silently, secretly saving the day. Thanks, Batman. If you like today's episode, please take a second to share it with a friend. We're always looking for new people to discover our show. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: Today\u2019s episode is a favorite from the HIDDEN BRAIN archives. It first aired in October 2018. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) VEDANTAM: This episode contains strong language and mature themes. If you're listening with young kids, I strongly urge you to save this one for later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There's an old saying - the best things in life are illegal, immoral or fattening. There's another way to think about this. Many things that give us pleasure - sex, food, adventure - they contain risks. As a smart species, we've come up with ways to minimize those risks - condoms, seat belts, drugs to lower cholesterol. But something interesting happens as we do this. As we move the risk-benefit calculation for each activity away from the risk end of the spectrum to the benefit end of the spectrum, we imagine people will become safer. Seat belts, for example, will keep drivers from getting hurt. Now, that would be true if people kept doing things exactly the way they did before. But some people make another calculation. If putting seat belts in cars means you are likely to survive a crash, there's now a temptation to go faster. An ocean swimmer might go out a little further when a lifeguard is nearby. Football players who know their heads are protected by helmets might start to hit a little harder. This phenomenon has a curious name. Economists call it moral hazard. It's a bit of a misnomer because moral hazard has little to do with morality. It's about what happens when you move the risk-benefit calculation to make things safer, and people respond by taking more risks. JENNIFER DOLEAC: So there was a paper a while back by Sam Peltzman that kind of lays out that the classic case of moral hazard that economists like to point to. VEDANTAM: This is economist Jennifer Doleac at Texas A&M University. DOLEAC: And his idea was that when seat belts first became required in cars, I think most people would assume when you have seat belts, that's unambiguously a good thing. It's going to save lives. And he saw that and thought, if you have a seat belt, maybe you drive a little bit more recklessly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sam Peltzman found that while drivers were safer because of seat belts, they also drove more recklessly. That put pedestrians at risk. He argued that the safety benefits of seat belts were canceled out when you took this into account. Now, subsequent studies have challenged this finding, but the seat belt example illustrates the dilemma posed by moral hazard. Should you make things safer if people are just going to take more risks? Or should you allow people to face the consequences of their actions by doing away with safety measures? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This dilemma has political dimensions. Liberals tend to say, the more safety measures, the better. Conservatives worry about the negative consequences that interventions might have on personal responsibility. So are safety measures useful? The answer is - it depends. There can be safety measures that cause so much moral hazard that they make things worse, and there can be other interventions where the benefits far outweigh the risks. Today, we consider this dilemma in the context of a deadly public health crisis. TIFFANY: I know I was dead for four minutes by the time the ambulance got there, but they revived me with Narcan. VEDANTAM: The opioid epidemic. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: He was playing Russian roulette. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JAMES: If they knew where the good dope was... JASMINE PIERCE: A grain as small as a piece of salt can kill a human, and it is 10,000 times more potent than morphine. JAMES: ...They would haul ass to get that shit, and they figure, OK, well, I'll just do a little bit, so it won't hurt me. VEDANTAM: Life, death and trade-offs - this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released an astonishing statistic. It estimates that, in 2017, about 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The vast majority of these deaths were caused by overdoses of heroin and other opioids. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: How do you understand the magnitude of 72,000 deaths? I don't know. But I can tell you one story. JENNIFER SCHMIDT, BYLINE: You want me to shut this front door? HOPE TROXELL: Yes, if you don't mind. I appreciate it. VEDANTAM: It unfolds in a tidy ranch home in Frederick, Md. My producer Jenny Schmidt and I have made the hour-long drive from Washington, D.C. We sit down at the kitchen table and start with introductions. H TROXELL: Yes, my name is Hope Troxell. PETE TROXELL: Hello, my name is Pete Troxell. VEDANTAM: Hope and Pete Troxell live in a neighborhood on a hill just outside of town. H TROXELL: I've been here all my life and - my husband and I both. P TROXELL: We've been married 46 years, lived in the same area. VEDANTAM: Hope exudes a comforting warmth. She's the kind of person you want to hug. Pete is tall and reserved, with long, white hair and a thick, white beard. It's not easy for them to share their story. Hope fidgets. Pete clenches his hands. They begin by telling us about the life they once had, a life that made sense. Their first child was their son Jeremy. P TROXELL: He's very easygoing. He doesn't get upset. H TROXELL: He's very quiet. He never said a whole lot when he was young. VEDANTAM: Four years later, Alicia arrived. H TROXELL: My daughter is more of a strong person. She was determined, more so than my son. VEDANTAM: Alicia was self-possessed, outgoing, a people person. She took risks, like the time when she was just 7 and decided she wanted to compete in a beauty pageant. Hope and Pete drove her to Virginia. Pete wore a tux. P TROXELL: 'Course, she didn't win, but she was so upset. But we had to tell her that, you know, life is full of disappointments, but you go to go on, and you got to move on. And she did. And she - I mean, she got over it. She was 7, 8 years old. She got over it and... H TROXELL: She came in the top 10. She was in the top 10. She didn't come in the first place, but she was in the top 10 out of the girls. VEDANTAM: Do you remember what she wore? P TROXELL: I remember she had a little gown on, but it was - had the little crown thing and all that. I can't remember what color, but it was a little long gown. And she's just so cute. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That memory of their little daughter in her long gown still makes them both smile. Hope says, as the kids grew older, they stayed close with their parents. Jeremy started working for his dad's trucking business. Hope says she and Alicia were like two peas in a pod. H TROXELL: You know, she had to call me every day, or I had to be on the phone with her. VEDANTAM: After Alicia finished high school, Hope convinced her to apply for a job at Fort Detrick, a nearby Army installation. Hope worked there, too. Alicia started as a cleaning person. Within a couple years, she was working in the mailroom. She was thriving. She met her soon-to-be husband, and she was pregnant - with twins. H TROXELL: And then my daughter decided, I'm going to go back to college. I said, how can you go to college when you're pregnant, going to have two little kids and go to college? So she says, I'm going to do it online. She would put them girls to bed, and then she would go online and do her college, and she got her associate's degree in business. So from there, from that, she moved up again and went to administrative assistant. And my daughter was making good money - really good money. VEDANTAM: They were proud. Pete says Alicia was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and a decade of hard work at Fort Detrick had paid off. P TROXELL: And I mean, things were going really good for her. VEDANTAM: But Alicia also had scoliosis, and as the years went by, it got worse. P TROXELL: 'Course, she had back problems. And, 'course, she went to the doctor, and they put her on oxycodone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It's a story of our time. Alicia started taking oxycodone in 2014. Her twin girls were now about 8 years old. Besides her back, there were other things in Alicia's life that weren't going great. She had split from her husband and was in the midst of a divorce. She'd moved back in with Pete and Hope, and the twins lived there, too, part of the time. The oxycodone didn't just help with the back pain. It made Alicia feel better about everything. Then, one day, Hope realized her own pain pills, the ones she'd been prescribed following a rotator cuff surgery, were running suspiciously low. H TROXELL: I would leave my pills set on the counter, and then I could see that maybe one, two pills are being taken, and I'm not taking them. Well, then I really started counting. I actually would start writing them down, when I would take my pills. And my pills should be lasting me longer. And, of course, I approached my daughter one day and, she said, well, Mom, my friend needed it. He's having back trouble, so my friend needed the pain pill. I said, you don't take my pain pills. You come to me first and ask me. VEDANTAM: Looking back on it, Hope thinks Alicia was already hooked. There were signs. H TROXELL: Like her work, going to work late, saying, Mom, I need to use this extra time from work. I have all this vacation time. I need to use some of this time from work. P TROXELL: I would, myself, would take the girls down to school, drop them off - noticed that, more and more, she was like, well, I'm going to be late. Dad, can you do this? And I'm like, you're already late for work. VEDANTAM: Soon, skipped hours turn into skipped days. P TROXELL: I told her one day, I said, you're going to end up losing your job. You got a very good job. Don't mess it up. But she - she did after a while, and they left her - they left her go from Fort Detrick. VEDANTAM: And then, things just got worse. H TROXELL: She just had a real hard time - what do I want to say - functioning. You know, she just couldn't seem to get herself together, to be able to even - with her girls. VEDANTAM: Eventually, she lost shared custody of the twins. H TROXELL: She was able to get her girls if she would do pee test. If she could get a clean urine, she could visit her girls at the Department of Social Services. VEDANTAM: It was after one of these visits that Hope and Pete believe Alicia finally lost whatever will she had to keep her life together. She'd driven with her parents for a supervised visit. Hope and Pete waited in the car. They watched Alicia walk inside, her arms filled with toys. H TROXELL: But when she came out of there, I could see her failing because she came out, and she was really crying. She said, they won't even let me hug them. They won't even let me kiss them. And that took my daughter downhill. P TROXELL: And she came out of there with her toys. The girls didn't want the toys, didn't want to get close to her. They left early, and when she came out that day, that - in my heart, and I believe 100% - that that was the turnaround point for her to get on heroin. VEDANTAM: Once Alicia started using heroin, she lost the remnants of her former life. First went the last few rights she had left as a mother. P TROXELL: The last time she was in court, the judge wouldn't even allow our daughter to talk to her girls on the phone. And I'm like, people in prison get to talk to their kids on the phone. VEDANTAM: So the - why did the judge not want... H TROXELL: Sometimes they felt when she did talk to the girls on the phone, that she - either she was nodding out or her speech was slurred. It's hard. I know it's hard for families with this situation, with the drugs. But when you have an addict, you have to help this person. VEDANTAM: But most people simply turned away from Alicia. Isolated and addicted, she burned through her savings. She got evicted from her apartment. She also started a new relationship and got pregnant. H TROXELL: She was six months about the time then. And I told her - I said, Alicia, you have to get straightened out, but she just couldn't. She could not help herself. She had gone to rehab, and she was only there five days, and she left. She just couldn't do it. VEDANTAM: But Pete and Hope kept fighting for their child. They worked with her, pleaded with her. Finally, something shifted in Alicia. She went back into rehab. This time, she made it through the 28-day program covered by Medicaid. When she came out, Pete and Hope opened their doors to her. She was seven months pregnant and very fragile. H TROXELL: She was home a week. She was doing great. VEDANTAM: She shopped for baby clothes. She watched TV at night with her parents. She met a friend for lunch. She and her dad had an honest talk. Pete told her that he loved her. Alicia said she was sorry for all she'd put them through. One night, Hope fixed Alicia her favorite meal - corned beef and cabbage. P TROXELL: And she was so happy that night. H TROXELL: Matter of fact, after we got done dinner, I went back with her. She had these little boy clothes, and her and I was folding them up and putting them away. And she was going to name the little boy - Camden was his name. And her and I were sitting there. Like my husband said, he'd come back there, and he told her that he loved her and that everything was going to work out. We all were going to work together. VEDANTAM: Eventually, Hope and Pete went to bed. In the morning, Hope walked to Alicia's room to bring her the medicine she took to stave off withdrawal symptoms. H TROXELL: And I went in, and her light was on. I went in and opened the door, and then I saw her. And she was slumped over. I hollered, Alicia, and she did not answer. And I hollered for my husband to come running. And he went around where she was at and tried to pull her back, and she was already stiff. So when I called 911, they told us to try to get her on the floor and use - give her compressions. And I told the woman - I said, ma'am, she's gone. I know she's gone. VEDANTAM: Camden was also dead. Alicia Troxell was 34 years old. She left behind her twin daughters, her parents, a brother. Hope and Pete wouldn't allow an autopsy because they didn't want to disturb their unborn grandchild. Hope says blood tests showed Alicia had taken a deadly dose of fentanyl. Having just finished rehab, she was especially vulnerable to an overdose because her body had just been detoxed. Alicia's addiction didn't just kill her - it destroyed the family. Hope and Pete no longer have any contact with their granddaughters. It's something that Hope struggles with. H TROXELL: My daughter's viewing that night before was so amazing. There was over 150 people there. And I wish my granddaughters could have seen that. They could have seen how loved my daughter was and how loved their grandparents were. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Hope's grief feels like a physical presence, thick in the air, hard to move through. H TROXELL: We lost a whole family. And I feel like I have lost my granddaughters, which was all I had left of my daughter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Alicia's story took place 72,000 times in 2017 to thousands of families, rich and poor, black and white and brown. The scale of this tragedy has generated horror and desperation. Legislators, communities and families have tried everything to stop the deaths. And then, a few years ago, something appeared that looked and sounded to many people like a miracle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Heroin sets off a chain reaction in the body. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Up to a point, it makes users feel euphoric. It takes away stress and pain. But then, if you increase the dose, heroin begins to affect vital functions. LEO BELETSKY: The person's system slows down to a point where they stop breathing, and then their brain basically shuts down. VEDANTAM: Leo Beletsky is a drug policy and public health researcher at Northeastern University. BELETSKY: And that process typically takes a substantial period of time. With traditional opioids, it can be up to two hours or more. VEDANTAM: Often, heroin sold on the streets is now laced with fentanyl and carfentanil. These synthetic opioids are cheaper and stronger. BELETSKY: And so overdose can occur in a matter of minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now, there has long been a way to reverse overdoses - the drug naloxone. Between 1996 and 2014, the CDC estimates that more than 26,000 overdoses were reversed by laypeople administering naloxone. Not medics, not doctors - ordinary people. Naloxone has been given the nickname the Lazarus drug. In the Bible, Jesus restores life to Lazarus. Naloxone doesn't restore the dead, but it comes close. BELETSKY: What happens is the person slowly starts to - their breathing starts to return to normal. Their skin starts to turn from its kind of white, ashen color - which is what happens during an overdose - and lips start to return from blue to normal color, and they start breathing again. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In late 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new form of naloxone that was much easier to use. It was a nasal spray, and it was a game changer. It was called Narcan, and it came at a critical time. Deaths from drug overdoses were skyrocketing. Across the country, massive education campaigns spread the word about the magic drug. PIERCE: We'll go ahead and start, but before I start, if you could pass your applications forward. VEDANTAM: On a Thursday morning, I'm in a packed conference room at a Maryland county health department. About 30 people sit in three rows. They fall silent as a woman steps to the front. PIERCE: So my name is Jasmine Pierce. I'm the overdose response coordinator for the Anne Arundel County Department of Health. You all are here for the naloxone-Narcan training. This training should be about 30 to... VEDANTAM: It's a free training event for the community that officials hold a couple of times a month. People are here to learn how to administer Narcan to overdose victims. PIERCE: At the end of this training, you will receive a naloxone kit. This kit has two doses of intranasal naloxone. We give two now due to the carfentanil and fentanyl overdoses that have occurred within our county. VEDANTAM: Fentanyl and carfentanil are so powerful that it often takes more than one dose of Narcan to bring a victim back. PIERCE: If you're not familiar with carfentanil, that is a tranquilizer used to put large animals down, such as elephants. A grain as small as a piece of salt can kill a human, and it is 10,000 times more potent than morphine. I always mention that we do provide gloves inside of the kits, as well, to protect you from any type of contamination because, with both of those drugs, they can actually seep through your skin with skin-to-skin contact, and you can overdose yourself. VEDANTAM: The CDC says the risk of overdose from such contact is very low. As Jasmine Pierce continues with the training, the people sitting in the three rows listen intently. Some look shocked. Some take notes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There's a high school nurse, a minister, an athletic trainer, a mother, a friend and lots of heartbreak. After the training session, their stories come tumbling out. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: My friend Jeff, his niece died of a heroin overdose. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Since a friend of mine's godson died, and then my son died. He was 22, you know, and he just couldn't - didn't want to stop is what it boiled down to. And, you know, he'd already overdosed, like, five times this year. So he knew it was - he was playing Russian roulette. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: And then my sister - she had overdosed in October. She came back. They were able to bring her back with the Narcan. And then last month, she died of an overdose at work on break. VEDANTAM: The trainer, Jasmine Pierce, has her own story. It's the one story everyone here wants to be able to tell - the story with a happy ending. PIERCE: I was going to 7-Eleven one morning before work, and I noticed there was a man in his car. He looked like he was sleeping, but I started to get a little worried because when I came back out, he looked blue to me. So I knocked on his window. He didn't respond, so thankfully his door was open. I opened his door. I checked his pulse, and I noticed that he was unconscious, and I didn't even think. I just went ahead and sprayed the Narcan, and within 30 seconds, he came back. VEDANTAM: This is the power of the Lazarus drug. Across the country, legislators have rushed to pass laws increasing access to naloxone. Some have urged every family in America to keep the drug close at hand. Public health officials have assured people that if they administer naloxone to someone who is not high on opioids, it won't do anything. With most drugs, you have to worry about misuse and unintended consequences. That wasn't true of naloxone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But then in early 2018, a study came out that suggested naloxone might indeed have an unintended consequence - one so cruel that it called into question all the good the drug was doing. This finding set off an uproar, with many experts rejecting its conclusions. The controversy reflects the mind-boggling complexities of the opioid epidemic and the labyrinth that confronts anyone who finds themselves in this world. DOLEAC: The growing interest and public push to broaden access to naloxone was - has been really interesting to me for a while. VEDANTAM: This, again, is Texas A&M economics professor Jennifer Doleac. Jennifer and a colleague, economist Anita Mukherjee from the University of Wisconsin, knew that naloxone was effective but... DOLEAC: There are always trade-offs. That's something we think about all the time as economists. What are the trade-offs involved? VEDANTAM: The biggest trade-off Jennifer and Anita were interested in was moral hazard. DOLEAC: So when it's less risky to consume opioids because naloxone provides a safety net, we might see opioid abuse increase. VEDANTAM: In other words, could having the safety net of naloxone prompt drug users to take more risks, like injecting bigger doses of heroin or stronger drugs like fentanyl? Answering such a question scientifically is very, very difficult. DOLEAC: The ideal experiment would be to randomly assign naloxone access to some states but not others. Obviously, that's not happening here, but it's helpful to think about that ideal experiment because it gives you a treatment and control group. VEDANTAM: Since the ideal data were not available, Jennifer and Anita came up with an indirect way to measure whether naloxone use was affecting opioid use. Some states were passing laws making it easier to get naloxone. The researchers decided to use these new laws as a proxy for people actually using naloxone and then compared states that had broadened access with those that had not. They would then test if there was any difference between these two groups in terms of opioid overdoses and mortality. It was an imperfect experiment, but this was the data they had. DOLEAC: Well, even then, you know, it's not random, and so we need to be really careful about making sure we're controlling for everything else that might be going on in those states that we think might have an impact, control for pre-existing trends, control for just pre-existing differences across states in levels of opioid use and other policies they might have implemented to address the crisis. VEDANTAM: With all those controls in place, they thought they may be able to answer the question, what effect was naloxone having on the heroin epidemic? On net, was it saving lives? DOLEAC: It seems reasonable that a drug that saves lives, you know, would on average have beneficial effects when you look at mortality rates. I think when we first got into this taper (ph), we really expected to see a big drop in opioid-related mortality as a result of these laws. VEDANTAM: But that is not what they found. DOLEAC: In fact, what we found was that on net we're not seeing any decline in mortality, and in some places, we actually see an increase in mortality. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It was a stunning result. To be fair, Jennifer and Anita found that some states did see a decline in mortality when they broadened access to naloxone. But on average nationwide, mortality did not decline. And in places like the Midwest... DOLEAC: We're finding that the naloxone access laws caused a 14% increase in opioid-related mortality relative to what would have happened without the law and also a big increase in fentanyl-related mortality - again, relative to the counterfactual - what would have happened without the law? VEDANTAM: Jennifer and Anita have a theory about what is going on. DOLEAC: Our interpretation is that, you know, the risk of death associated with a kind of unit use of heroin or prescription pills has fallen now due to naloxone, but the number of uses and the potency of uses has gone up so much that it actually - it doesn't just reduce the mortality benefits, but it completely counteracts them, in the Midwest in particular. And so what seems to be happening is that opioid use is going up so much as a result of broader access to naloxone that we're actually seeing an increase in mortality rather than a decrease. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Shortly after Jennifer and Anita disseminated a working paper about their results, the pushback came fast and hard from public health experts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Critics pointed to studies that had reached very different conclusions. At the University of Colorado Denver, for example, Daniel Rees and his colleagues found that a state's expanded access to naloxone, there was about a 10% decline in mortality. And at the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Chandler McClellan and his colleagues found an even bigger decline in mortality between the early 2000s and 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Public health researcher Leo Beletsky says Jennifer and Anita's paper was based on flawed assumptions and flawed methodology. BELETSKY: It's basically what computer scientists call garbage in, garbage out. VEDANTAM: For one thing, Leo says, the paper argued that state laws expanding naloxone access signaled an increased availability of naloxone in those states. But Leo says this is wrong. Laws making drugs more available and a drug actually being available are two different things. BELETSKY: So let's say, you know, the state of New York - does the state of New York have a naloxone law or doesn't it have the law is not necessarily a proxy for whether or not naloxone is available on the streets of New York state. VEDANTAM: Leo has worked on getting such laws passed. BELETSKY: Can say with certainty that in many cases the presence of the law was actually a consequence of naloxone being available in some areas. So, you know, in York City, naloxone distribution started back in the late 1990s, for example. The first naloxone law in New York state was passed in 2013. VEDANTAM: Now, it's worth noting that this critique of Jennifer and Anita's paper also applies in part to the papers we mentioned that found that naloxone reduced mortality. Leo says Jennifer and Anita's paper not only misconstrues what's happening on the ground but jeopardizes hard-won advances. BELETSKY: We have worked for a long time to get these naloxone laws passed, and in many cases, there were - there was a lot of resistance based on the moral hazard argument in the legislatures to get these naloxone laws passed. VEDANTAM: It was only the skyrocketing death toll that caused lawmakers to act. Leo worries that the \"Moral Hazard\" paper will cause legislatures to pull back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jennifer and Anita stand by their results. DOLEAC: It's not lost on us at all that these are lives that we're talking about and that the increase in mortality that we're seeing - you know, these are actual people who have lost their lives due to addiction. And it's depressing just how - with so many smart people thinking about this, it feels like we're no closer to solving the problem. VEDANTAM: The truth is we don't fully understand how addiction works. We're still figuring out how to help people quit. We have trouble identifying even what's happening in the course of an epidemic because addiction is stigmatized, and people can't talk honestly about their behavior. The data are incredibly messy regardless of whether you're wearing the hat of an economist like Jennifer Doleac or a public health scholar like Leo Beletsky. At the same time that states were expanding access to naloxone, for example, there was an influx of powerful synthetic opioids into the country. Heroin is increasingly laced with them. It's possible the recent rise in opioid deaths was driven by the surge in synthetic drugs that have flooded the streets. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It isn't just families and researchers and policymakers who are grappling with these life-and-death issues. Drug users engage in these debates as well using a mental calculus of their own. TIFFANY: People that have mentioned they got that Bad Batch app now on your phone and people pin where bad batches of dope are. And there's people that download that just to go find the bad batches and do it. VEDANTAM: No way. TIFFANY: Yeah. JAMES: Yes, yes, it's on there. VEDANTAM: No way. TIFFANY: Yeah. VEDANTAM: Coming up - the dangerous logic that seeks to balance the risk of death with euphoria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. On the day that I attended the Narcan training at the Anne Arundel County Department of Health, I met two people who'd come to the on-site clinic for their daily dose of methadone. It's a drug that helps reduce withdrawal symptoms from heroin. One person was using it to stay off heroin, the other to keep from using too much. We sat down at a picnic bench to chat. We'll only be using their first names. JAMES: My name is James [name bleeped]. VEDANTAM: And let me get you to tell me your name, please. TIFFANY: Tiffany [name bleeped]. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tiffany is 24 with dark hair and glasses. James is 59, graying and weathered. They should have little in common, and yet their stories are painfully similar. James started using heroin when he was just 13, a poor kid, he says, from East Baltimore. JAMES: Well, when we grew up, my father left us with my mother. He had six children. And my father left us with nothing. And he had... VEDANTAM: To help his mom, James says he started hustling on the streets and carrying guns for drug dealers. Then he started carrying their dope and using it. It made him feel better about his life. JAMES: I didn't want to go to school - I home-schooled (ph) - because all my clothes were all holey - this, that and the other. My mother had to go to churches, the veteran store, for just, like, a nickel pair of pants, a nickel pair of - a shirt, 10 cent pair of shoes. And, you know, you get tired of that. And then... VEDANTAM: Tiffany started her drug habit at exactly the same age as James. TIFFANY: I started doing - I started doing the Percocets when I was 13. So from 13... VEDANTAM: And like James, she says she was pretty unhappy as a kid. Percocet filled the missing parts of her life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When the pills got harder to obtain, she moved on to heroin. TIFFANY: And it was just easier to get and around more. It was cheaper and, I mean, you really got higher off of it in a less amount, so... VEDANTAM: It's a logic that's common to opioid use. Some users would prefer heroin to Percocet because it's cheaper and stronger. And then they might prefer synthetic opioids to heroin for the very same reason. What public health officials warn about drugs like fentanyl, some users go looking for them. JAMES: If they knew where the good dope was, and people were falling out and dying from this shit - right? - they would run right to get - so they wouldn't - before they sold out. They would haul ass to get that shit, and they figured, OK, well, I'll just do a little bit so it won't hurt me. TIFFANY: Yeah, there's plenty of people that do it. And there's even people that have mentioned they got that Bad Batch app now on your phone, and people pin where bad batches of dope are. And there's people that download that just to go find the bad batches and do it. VEDANTAM: No way. TIFFANY: Yeah. VEDANTAM: Tiffany is referring to a text messaging service that uses data from public health officials. She says that figuring out where the best dope is available at the cheapest price is part of the daily calculation of heroin use. For her part, she spent about $50 a day on her heroin habit. TIFFANY: I know $50 - that's not really a lot compared to some people I know. VEDANTAM: Really? TIFFANY: Yeah, I know some people that would be going through... JAMES: I was doing hundreds. I had a dealer habit. TIFFANY: One hundred fifty dollars - $250 a day JAMES: I had a dealer habit. VEDANTAM: A dealer habit. Since he was selling the stuff himself, James had easy access to both money and dope. Sometimes he'd take a little bit for himself before passing the rest on to his customers. JAMES: I'd just take the head out of each one. TIFFANY: Oh, you'd skimp it. JAMES: Yeah, but then I was capping it up, as well. VEDANTAM: There were a lot of moments like this when James and Tiffany riffed off each other, building on their shared language of heroin. Another thing they share - they've both overdosed multiple times. The first time for Tiffany was when she was 17. TIFFANY: I just did it and fell out. I don't remember. I know - I know I was dead for four minutes by the time the ambulance got there. But they revived me with Narcan. JAMES: I've seen it happen so many times. TIFFANY: I've overdosed nine times. JAMES: Me - 12. VEDANTAM: Tiffany has overdosed nine times; James - 12. They owe their lives to Narcan. James says he now always keeps a life-saving drug close at hand. JAMES: I got five or six nasal spray Narcans up in my room. So if somebody falls out around me, ain't no ambulance. I just take the Narcan - it's like a nose - like, you know what I mean? You just put - you hold your fingers on it. It looks like a long stem, and it goes like that, and it's got another thing pointing - comes down here that you push in, like that. So you catch them when they're breathing in and then out. Then once they're breathing back in, that's when you shoot it up their nose. Not even 10, 15 seconds later, they're arrived, they're back. And so whoever made that Narcan is some - has some serious ways of saving people's lives, I'm telling you. VEDANTAM: But Narcan also does something unpleasant to users who are high. It brings them crashing down really fast. JAMES: When you - when you put that Narcan in you, it eats everything in your - any narcotic, anything you got in your system, it eats it all out. I mean, it's like Scrubbing Bubbles and just goes right through you so fast. VEDANTAM: And that is not a good feeling. To go from a heroin high to an internal scrub feels awful. That's why many people who are revived with Narcan immediately try to get high again. Tiffany, when the first time this happened to you, do you recall the - you, obviously, don't recall the emergency people coming to your house, but do you recall what happened right after? TIFFANY: I remember going into the emergency room. They sat there. And I had to stay there until I was fully coherent. VEDANTAM: Did you have a sense that you actually came close to dying? TIFFANY: Yeah. I knew. And as soon as I got out, I did more. It happened every single time I overdosed. I did more as soon as I got out of the hospital, and yeah. VEDANTAM: It was a revolving door - heroin, overdose, Narcan, heroin, overdose, Narcan. I asked Tiffany and James whether Narcan was causing users to take risks that they would not have taken otherwise. They rejected the idea that Narcan was the reason anyone would choose to get high, but they said the drug might affect how much heroin people use. JAMES: To where I've noted people say, all right, because I got Narcan - right? - they're just going to amp it up more. VEDANTAM: Tiffany has a friend who was quite explicit about what Narcan does for his drug habit. TIFFANY: I know he's mentioned to me quite a few times that, you know, if he falls out, he'll come back. They'll come and give him Narcan and bring him back. VEDANTAM: So would her friend stop using heroin if he didn't have Narcan? TIFFANY: No, there ain't no way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tiffany sees the moral hazard dilemma of heroin and Narcan. TIFFANY: I think that it makes people not be as careful about it, but I also think that there ain't no way that they should take it away because then people are going to be dropping left and right. Look at everybody that it saves. VEDANTAM: And among the everybody that it saves is Tiffany. After multiple overdoses and a blood infection from shooting up the destroyed part of her heart, she finally had enough. TIFFANY: I was just - I don't know. I was just done with that kind of life. Like, I just really sat down and thought about it one day and how I imagined my life to be and who I was going to be, and that just wasn't how I wanted to live no more. VEDANTAM: And what did you - when you thought about how you imagined your life was supposed to be and how it had turned out, what went through your head? What did you see, in terms of what your life had become? TIFFANY: Just everything that addiction does to you. Like, I wasn't even me no more. You do things that aren't you. And knowing of how many times I've died, just none of it even made any sense to me. VEDANTAM: Tiffany now needs methadone to keep withdrawal at bay. She has a heart that beats only because the damaged portion was replaced with part of a cow's heart. But Tiffany is alive, and at 24, she really does have a whole life ahead of her. She's grateful for the chance and would willingly give it to someone else. That's why, even though she isn't using anymore, she always makes sure she has Narcan close at hand. TIFFANY: Yeah, I don't want nothing to happen to somebody and me not be able to save them. I couldn't - I couldn't live with being able to see somebody die and knowing that I could've did something. VEDANTAM: The opioid crisis in America is like a wildfire, racing through towns and cities, consuming individual lives and families and whole communities. Sometimes, amidst all the smoke and fire, you can barely see what's going on. It's likely, in the coming years, there will be more hard data on the effects of naloxone. For now, the best we can do is to come to terms with the trade-offs, to accept that the interventions we develop to save people might sometimes lead to unintended and unwanted consequences. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: At those times, it's worth remembering what we are doing right. The people we pull from the flames - charred, damaged, but not yet destroyed. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Jenny Schmidt and Parth Shah. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Camila Vargas Restrepo. Our team includes Rhaina Cohen, Thomas Lu and Laura Kwerel. Special thanks this week to Ashley Messenger, Mark Memmott and Neal Carruth. Our unsung hero this week is Elin Jones, the public information director at the Anne Arundel County Department of Health. Elin invited us to sit in on one of the county's Narcan training sessions. She also encouraged community members to speak with us. Elin and her colleagues at the Anne Arundel County Department of Health are the front-line responders to the opioid epidemic. Even as we focus on helping families and those struggling with addiction, we should all be immensely grateful to folks like Elin, who are dealing with a difficult and heartbreaking job of keeping people alive. For more HIDDEN BRAIN, you can follow us on Facebook and Twitter. If you like this episode, please consider sharing it with a friend and then sitting down to chat with your friend about your reactions to it. Good people will disagree when it comes to questions about moral hazard, but we will all be better off if we can learn from the views of others. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR.

        "title": "Are You A Fox Or A Hedgehog?  : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We like stories about leaders who have big ideas, who defy the odds and pursue their goals with messianic purpose. Think of Winston Churchill in World War II or Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. But what happens when a leader's vision is the wrong one? How do we think about people who dream big only to invite disaster? At such times, we might prefer a more cautious style, someone who plays the odds. Those leaders might not score historic triumphs, but they rarely cause catastrophes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Thousands of years ago, the Greek poet Archilochus summed up this idea. He said, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. PHIL TETLOCK: That parable has been the subject of much debate over the last 2,500 years - what exactly Archilochus meant. VEDANTAM: This is psychologist Phil Tetlock. TETLOCK: Various people have offered various interpretations - some people coming out on the side of the hedgehog, saying the hedgehog will trump the fox, and other people saying, no, it really means the fox is going to do better. VEDANTAM: There are different ways to think about the metaphor, but here's how I see it. If a fox wants dinner, it has many options. It can chase down a hedgehog. It can find something else to eat. It can even go without food for a day. But if you're a hedgehog being chased by a fox, you don't have multiple goals. You have one overarching idea - don't get eaten. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Phil Tetlock thinks this metaphor also describes two different cognitive styles among people. Foxes have different strategies for different problems. They're comfortable with nuance. They can live with contradictions. Hedgehogs focus on the big picture. They see every problem through the lens of a single organizing principle. TETLOCK: The hedgehogs are more parsimonious, more decisive. In most MBA programs, they'd probably be viewed as better leadership material. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we're listening back to our May 2017 show that tells the story of a hedgehog - a surgeon who changed the world in daring ways. His bold style made him a pioneer in what has today become the transgender movement. It also propelled him to create one of the world's first international medical missions. Like other hedgehogs, this surgeon experienced outsized success until one day, he didn't. DON LAUB: It's just a goddamned disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: Greatness and tragedy, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone was born in 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. Her parents gave her a Hebrew name. SANDY STONE: It was Zelig Ben-Natan (ph). VEDANTAM: Zelig Ben-Natan - a boy's name. That's because her parents thought she was a boy. But from a very early age, she knew she was a girl. This was a long time ago, decades before the modern trans movement. When Sandy was a child, there were no words, no language to describe what she knew about herself. STONE: It was lonely. It was disorienting. It was puzzling, confusing, scary. It was all of those things. VEDANTAM: It stayed like that for Sandy all the way into adulthood. She went to school, became a recording engineer, moved to the Bay Area. All the while, everyone thought she was a man. She kept searching for help. In the San Francisco phone book, she found a promising lead. It was a group for gay men. When she called, they asked if she was gay. She said she wasn't, so they sent her away and told her to try another group. The outfit they recommended surprised Sandy. It was the San Francisco Police Department. STONE: It turned out that the police department was running a counseling unit of sorts, which they did for the population of transgender people that lived in the San Francisco Tenderloin, which was sort of the down-and-out skid row section of town that tended to collect people who couldn't afford to live anywhere else or who had run out of options. VEDANTAM: Trans people who ended up in the Tenderloin were at high risk for drug addiction and prostitution. They were social outcasts. When Sandy got in touch with the police to ask for help, the first thing they did was to dissuade her from acting on her feelings. STONE: And they actually tried to discourage me by taking me on a tour that reminded me of Dante being led down into the lower circles of hell. They really showed me the worst of everything, and then said, are you sure you still want to go ahead with what you were thinking of? And to be perfectly honest, I was not quite sure what I was thinking of. I was just trying to collect information. And I think it would be safe to say that that's what we were all doing at that time. VEDANTAM: Still, the referral to the police turned out to be a stroke of luck. The cops told her that a center at Stanford University had recently started performing what were then called sex change operations. STONE: They didn't refer me to Stanford as much as talk about it as the great, unattainable goal - the great, beautiful, shining star in the sky. VEDANTAM: After years of suffering and loneliness and confusion, the Stanford program felt like a beacon. Sandy felt she might finally have a chance to live a more honest, satisfying life. But first, she had to convince the gatekeeper who stood between her and the person she wanted to become. He ran what was then called the gender dysphoria program at Stanford. His name was Don Laub. The gatekeeper of Stanford's gender dysphoria program was a hedgehog. From a very early age, he had a big-picture idea. He wanted to help people. He wanted to help a lot of people. As a small child, when kids in his school were asked to donate money to a charity, his classmates contributed a dime. Don worked in a vegetable garden an entire summer to raise a whopping $10. LAUB: Now, I got a letter, a preserved letter from - that my mother wrote to some of her friends saying, Don, he's done something that nobody has ever done. VEDANTAM: Don's father feared his little boy was consumed with being a do-gooder, that he would turn out to be a failure at business. His father was right. Don Laub became a doctor. When he came to Stanford in the 1960s, he was a young, ambitious plastic surgeon very much in awe of his prize-winning colleagues. LAUB: Coming to Stanford, I was overshadowed by the hugeness of what people were doing - the importance of it. So I knew that I had to do something, like, maybe - you know, I got to do this somewhere along the line because everybody else here is doing it. VEDANTAM: Don was looking for a place to make his mark. One day, a colleague walked out of an examination room and came up to him. LAUB: And said, Don, I want you to see a patient. It's a good case. You might not like it. It's a sex change. VEDANTAM: Remember; this was 1968. LAUB: I said, Dave (ph), send that patient away. I'm a Catholic boy from the Midwest, and I'm at Stanford. We don't do those things. VEDANTAM: But Don's colleague insisted he meet the patient. To be clear, this patient was not Sandy Stone. LAUB: He said, do me a favor, and go in that room. So I went in the room and talked to the patient. And I said, now, why do you want this sex change? She said, well, I was born, and this is what I should be. I said, well, when did you decide that? She said, I didn't decide it. This is what I was born with from day one. VEDANTAM: This patient was a pioneer. No one on the West Coast had received what's come to be known today as gender reassignment surgery or gender confirmation surgery. In fact, the surgery had been rarely performed across the whole world. Don was an unlikely choice of doctor. He was, by his own account, a prim man from the Midwest. But although Don initially blanched at the idea of gender reassignment surgery, he felt a shiver of excitement. He didn't send the patient away. Instead, he went looking for information. He consulted with psychiatrists and the few surgeons around the world who'd already performed this kind of surgery. What prompted you, this sort of, you know, Catholic doctor from the Midwest, to basically take this on? It seems like an unlikely fit. LAUB: It was a wonderful opportunity to do a big thing and to help a lot of people. VEDANTAM: Altruism and ambition were always tightly woven in Don's identity. He wasn't interested in superficial cosmetic work. He wanted to change the world. He decided to take the leap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In November 1968, Don Laub performed California's first gender reassignment surgery. LAUB: Yeah, we were more than prepared for all of the things that might happen. And the surgery went fine. It took about 3 1/2 hours, and we did it with the skin graft method and no problem. VEDANTAM: Don soon became one of the world's leading experts on gender reassignment surgery. He started a program. His reputation grew - a reputation for being a good surgeon and a tough gatekeeper. He turned away many people because he felt they weren't good candidates for surgery. Sandy Stone vividly remembers her first appointment with him in the mid-'70s. STONE: I go in and sit down, and Don is behind his desk. And he's wearing his white coat. And he's very distinguished-looking and calm and very friendly and open. And he says, well, what can I do for you? And I say the first thing that comes into my head, which is, I think I'm a woman. Now, the scene we have is Don behind his desk and me - I'm - I have a long black beard and wild black hair. I'm wearing a blue shirt, jeans and engineer's boots. I do not exactly look like I'm thinking of myself as a stereotypical woman. And Don looks at me and says, really? And I say, what should I do? I mean, I'm totally - I'm completely open to anything. And I really don't know what I should do, what direction I should move in, what's right, what's wrong. And I'm looking to Donald to tell me. And in my memory of the thing, Donald then says, well, the first thing you should do is lose the beard. VEDANTAM: That was the beginning of Sandy's long, transformative journey. It was a tough journey. Don wanted Sandy to be sure she was making the right decision. So before he would even consider surgery, Sandy says he told her she would have to live openly and fully as a woman for one full year. It was a requirement based on the reality of the time. No one, not Sandy nor Don, knew what might come from these surgeries in the long term. These were early days. It was all a bit of an experiment, a shot in the dark. STONE: It was fraught. It was fraught for everyone. And it was fraught because, at that time, it was not clear what would happen later. We didn't have very many examples of transgender people who had had surgery who went on to have fulfilling lives and live to tell about it, which is to say, came back later and reported back to the program. VEDANTAM: They were experimenting on the fringe of what both medicine and society thought was acceptable. Don was taking risks with his professional reputation. Sandy was taking risks with her life. There was one moment, Sandy says, when she and Don clashed. The conflict boiled down to their cognitive styles. STONE: At some point, he asked me if I were 100% committed to wanting surgery. And I said, no, I'm not. I'm probably 99.9%. I think anyone who is 100% committed to anything is probably crazy. You have to have some reservations in life. You have to have an overview of everything that you're doing and have alternative plans if what you're looking for doesn't work out. And Don said, well, in that case, you're not eligible for surgery. You have to be 100% committed. VEDANTAM: It took a mediated session with Don's assistant for the two of them to resolve the conflict. But the incident revealed something about the way a hedgehog moves through the world. Hedgehogs are decisive. Don could not understand anything less than 100% commitment, even if the .1% of doubt was simply a way to say, I'm human, how can I be absolutely sure? Sandy tells another story of a time she came in for an appointment wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Don asked her why she wasn't dressed like a woman. He'd missed the bell-bottom-jeans-and-tie-dye revolution happening right outside his window. It was the kind of thing that could have led to a fight, except for one thing. Sandy understood where Don was coming from. She knew that underneath the tough exterior, he really wanted to help and not just in a medical sense. More than anything, Don wanted Sandy to live a life where she didn't feel like an outcast. STONE: He wanted his people to be totally unremarkable, to just fit in, to be able to live their lives, to be able to be inconspicuous and just get along. And that's a good thing to want for 99% of your waking day is just to be able to live your life, to be able to live with other people and not rub people the wrong way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Sandy Stone successfully underwent surgery in 1977. When I interviewed Sandy, I told her that her story reminded me of another case that Don told me about. It's interesting because I - Don first came to my attention because of another case involving cleft lip surgery, and it's so striking that as you're saying this, I'm sort of hearing echoes of that other work as well, this drive that he had to just help people to essentially live what he would think of as being a normal life, a life that they're not ostracized and a life that they're not feeling like they're outcasts, that they're functioning, they are - they can get an education if they're a child or they can get a job if they're an adult, that they can be happy. And I feel there's something actually very Midwestern about that idea. STONE: That's the word. That word you said is correct. Don wanted people to be happy. Don did it professionally. His job was to help people to be happy. And for that, I owe him a lifetime debt. I would not have done anything, I think, that I did after the 1980s if it weren't for Don Laub - or the '70s rather - if it weren't for Don Laub. VEDANTAM: Sandy went on to become a prominent writer and theorist and eventually helped found the academic discipline of transgender studies. When she considers Don's influence on her life, she hones in on his willingness to pursue a big idea with single-minded purpose. STONE: Do you go for the big one, or do you accept something less? And many of us accept something less because we don't want to take the risk, and then we may go through life maybe - maybe we'll be happy with our measure or maybe we'll say, what if I had gone for what I really wanted? What would that have been like? Maybe I would have died. Yeah, maybe, I would have. But I didn't. I beat the odds, and I went on to be gloriously happy. That's something in life, and Don brought that to many people. I don't see how one could do better than that. VEDANTAM: Don's leap into the unknown, his willingness to bet his professional reputation on a big idea, his confidence in his own judgment - it had all paid off. The hedgehog had won, but pursuing a big idea with determination doesn't always pay off. And when a hedgehog fails, the fall can be painful. Don Laub knows about that part of the story, too. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: According to the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. Psychologist Phil Tetlock says the metaphor describes two kinds of people. Small-picture tacticians are foxes. Big-picture strategists are hedgehogs. Before Don Laub became a world-renowned gender reassignment surgeon, he had another big idea. It started this way. One day, a colleague asked him if he could help with a surgery. The patient was a child from Mexico. LAUB: This was a 14-year-old boy who had no other deformity than his cleft lip and palate. VEDANTAM: But because of it, the boy was shunned. A group of priests had driven him north all the way to Stanford to get him help. Don immediately understood that the cleft lip wasn't just a medical problem. LAUB: He had not gone to school. He had no educational advancement. He had no friends. VEDANTAM: The surgery to repair the cleft lip and palate was simple and quick. It was so easy, and it gave this child a real chance in life. Don says performing the surgery made him feel really good. As someone with deep religious roots and a Catholic education that emphasized helping the poor, Don felt this was the kind of patient he wanted to serve. He turned to the priests who brought the boy from Mexico. LAUB: I asked them, are there other patients in Mexico like this? They said, the place is full of them. So we bought an airplane ticket and went down to Mexicali and asked for a clinic. VEDANTAM: Just like that, where a fox may have calculated the odds, considered the upside and the downside, the hedgehog simply picked up and went. In Mexicali, Don found a dusty border town in the desert where the people were very poor. LAUB: I mean, most of the houses were made of packing crates at that time, and there was no paving in Mexicali of 200,000 people. VEDANTAM: Mexicali's main medical facility was an old, wood home. LAUB: It had a dirt floor for part of it with the back part of the clinic was used to raise fighting cocks. VEDANTAM: A rational fox may have calculated the risks and backed down - not Don. He recruited local health officials to get word out that they would be providing free surgeries for children with cleft lips and burn scars. The clinic was quickly packed. LAUB: It was 10:30 in the morning. In that desert, there had not been rain there for three years. Hot in the morning - it was about 106 degrees already. You couldn't touch anything metal because you'd burn your hand. The first patient I saw was sitting there with a bag on his head with two little peepholes. I said, what's with the - why the bag? VEDANTAM: Behind those peepholes, the boy was hiding his face in shame. Don asked if he could take a look. LAUB: So he got the bag off, and he had a burn scar that pulled his eyelid down - a simple thing to repair. VEDANTAM: As with Sandy, Don wanted to make the little boy unremarkable. He wanted him to lead an ordinary life, unmarked by stigma and shame. That first trip was just a fact-finding mission, a way to see if there was a need. By the time Don went back to Stanford, a plan had formed in his mind. He wanted to recruit the best doctors from the United States and fly them to Mexico to perform free surgeries on children with birth defects. He recruited surgical residents to join skilled surgeons on the trips. He found pilots willing to transport medical equipment. Hedgehogs have charisma. They can see the shining city on the hill so clearly that everyone around them starts to see it, too. LAUB: Everybody jumped on it. I had to hide when I'd go in the hospital because people wanted to get in on this. VEDANTAM: In 1966, the official medical missions began. Now, it's important to remember that at this time, the idea of plastic surgeons going abroad to provide free surgery was almost unheard off. There were fewer parameters of how international aid organizations should operate. Don was flying by the seat of his pants. Every few months, the doctors would descend on Mexicali. They'd throw themselves into four marathon days of back-to-back surgeries and consultations. Over the years, they'd come back again and again, performing more than 2,000 surgeries in all. One of Don's first patients was a little boy named Eugenio (ph). He was the boy who'd worn the bag over his head. Don repaired the scarred eyelid and still remembers the boy's first reaction. LAUB: He had a very nice, huge smile. VEDANTAM: On a follow-up trip, Don tracked Eugenio down. LAUB: He shook hands and everything like that, even as a young kid. And he said, I have friends in school now. VEDANTAM: Don loved it. LAUB: It's a real happiness. It's a source of happiness is the best description. HOWARD HOLDERNESS: With - if anything, Don had a - I would describe it as a very - and I think he would accept this. I think it was a very sort of a missionary zeal. VEDANTAM: This is plastic surgeon Howard Holderness. He was part of the team of residents helping perform surgeries in Mexicali. Howard says that Don's vision drove the whole team. HOLDERNESS: I think he felt very close to trying to do things that - not only practice medicine in its - in all of its forms of science and everything, but the art of medicine and some of the spiritual aspects of being a good doctor. VEDANTAM: He was doing more than surgeries. Don was developing a program that could set an example for others to follow around the world. One day about two years into the Mexico program, a woman arrived at the clinic with her young son. His name was Salvador (ph). Compared with the other patients, Salvador had a more severe birth defect. He had bilateral clefs - two clefs rather than one. LAUB: When you have this bilateral, the muscles are cut twice. So when you smile, they pull out. If they're repaired, they pull in. See? So every time he would have a visual expression, it would be awful. You'd see these teeth on both sides. VEDANTAM: Salvador was a perfect candidate for surgery, that is, until a doctor on the team gave the boy a thorough physical and listened to his heart with a stethoscope. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT) LAUB: His mother brought him in and the pediatrician listened and it goes whoosh, whoosh, whoosh - the heart sounds. VEDANTAM: These were not normal sounds. The boy's heart had a hole in it. The risk of proceeding with surgery was small but potentially fatal. They gave the mother the bad news. LAUB: We can't operate because we don't have the equipment in Mexicali to do the heart catheterization or anything like that or any - even get the EKG today so... VEDANTAM: So Don and his team turned away the mother and the little boy. I should say here that we're going only on Don's account of what happened. The medical records from that era are incomplete, and we weren't able to find the mother. A few months after sending the child away, Don and his team were back in Mexicali. The mother and her son were waiting for them again. Salvador, she told them, was shunned. He had no friends. Other children called him el monstre, the monster. LAUB: The mother said, this child has no chance in life. You've got to fix it. VEDANTAM: Don's heart went out to the little boy. He explained the danger again. The risk was small, but it did mean that things could go seriously wrong. Don held the stethoscope up to the mother's ears. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARTBEAT) LAUB: Listen. She can hear it - whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. VEDANTAM: So the answer again was no. More months passed. Don returned to the clinic. So did the mother. LAUB: Por favor, please, doctor. Can you see that this child has no life? VEDANTAM: This was a critical moment. Don could again have said no. Medical protocol said that was the right call. But Don also knew that without surgery, Salvador would always be an outcast. Could he have tried to take the boy back to Stanford where heart surgeons could have assisted with his care? Maybe but that would have been complicated, expensive and a drain on critical resources from the project in Mexico, resources that were helping hundreds of other children. So Don did what Don always did. He took a look at the child, took a deep breath and said, OK, we'll do it. LAUB: I feel like that's why I existed is for this judgment. I mean, I'm not there to take care of little pimples. I'm there to do the tough cases. So this was putting it right on a line. You've got to do it or put your tail between your legs and get out of there. VEDANTAM: It's been nearly 50 years since Don Laub performed that surgery on a 6-year-old boy in Mexicali, Mexico. He's had thousands of patients since then, but the details of that day are still vivid in his mind. The morning of the surgery, the boy went through the standard pre-surgery lab tests and check-up, an IV was started and he received extra glucose in case his blood sugar was low from stomach worms. And then the boy walked by himself into the operating room. LAUB: And he gets on the operating table himself because he trusts the whole world. VEDANTAM: The surgery began. First, the child was anesthetized. LAUB: So that went fine. It went perfect, no problem at all. VEDANTAM: Then Don and his team began the surgery. LAUB: When we were operating, everything was going perfect. VEDANTAM: And then just like that, it wasn't. LAUB: The anesthesiologist said, boys, we have no pulse. VEDANTAM: They tried everything - CPR, medicine to jumpstart the heart - nothing worked. Don suspected a blood clot. The boy was dead. They put away their surgical tools. They wheeled the body to the morgue. All the while, Don's heart was starting to race. He was working in a foreign country, and he had made a risky judgment call in violation of medical protocol. LAUB: My mind is going 1,000 miles a minute. Why am I here in Mexico? Why did I get into this? What the hell is the matter with you? Here you are in a foreign country. You're going to end up in jail. It's just a goddamn disaster, an awful thing. VEDANTAM: And, of course, there was the boy's mother waiting anxiously outside for news of her son. Don remembers stepping out of the operating room and walking up to her. He told her there'd been complications, that they had tried hard, but the boy had died. The mother began to sob. But then, Don says, she did something surprising. She asked him why he was upset. LAUB: She said, you should be happy because the child is seeing God with a complete face. VEDANTAM: Don had expected accusation and anger. Instead, he encountered a mother who leaned heavily on her faith. Don says she was comforted by the thought that her child was now repaired and beautiful and at home with God. Salvador was finally at peace. Don stared at the mother. He was speechless, not just because of what she'd said but because he was struck by another thought. The mother didn't know this, but Salvador's face was not repaired. He died before the surgery was complete. What would the mother say when she saw her son at the funeral? Again, the medical protocol was clear. Don had to turn the body over to Salvador's mother, but he felt he couldn't bring himself to do this. It would only compound the first tragedy. He conferred with his team about finishing the surgery on Salvador. LAUB: I said, it's against the law, but I think in this case, we should. VEDANTAM: The rest of the team unanimously agreed. The little boy was brought back from the morgue. LAUB: The child came back in a body bag, and we did the whole thing as if the child was awake. VEDANTAM: I interviewed Don several times for this story. I pushed hard to understand why he decided to operate on Salvador. What were you telling yourself, again, emotionally that made you change your mind, that made you say, yes, I recognize there's a risk, but I have to do this? LAUB: I thought this is what I am for. This is my purpose... VEDANTAM: And you said it's worth... LAUB: ...I mean, I was standing there, and I couldn't say no again. I didn't. I couldn't, and I made that - when I said that, let's go ahead and do the case, I didn't have any second thoughts. I - emotionally, I figured out that this is what I should do. VEDANTAM: Don still thinks about Salvador, has thought about him thousands of times over the years. He's turned the case over in his head in every possible way. I asked him over and over whether he felt regret. LAUB: No. Well, I (laughter) - of course, I do. Of course, I do. Yes, I do. I mean, as you said just a minute ago, it was a mistake. But I don't have - I'm not whipping myself. VEDANTAM: Not whipping himself, Don says, because he was trying to do the right thing. That's the reason he decided to operate. That's the reason he completed the surgery after the child was dead. What was more important than being on the right side of the law? LAUB: Doing the right thing. VEDANTAM: By the mother and by the child? LAUB: Yes. Yeah. No, you must always do the right thing. That is the highest priority over all different laws and commandments or any of that thing. You have to do the right thing. VEDANTAM: The day after Salvador died, Don Laub was back in the operating room. There were more children waiting for surgery. He remembers looking out the windows at the sky. It was, he says, a perfect azure blue. At 10:30, the time when Salvador was to be buried, everyone on the team fell silent and paused. There was no sound except for the whoosh of the anesthesia machine. When we think of foxes and hedgehogs, it's completely understandable that we want the best of both worlds. We love bold visionaries who take big risks, except when the risks don't work. At moments like that, we prefer the visionaries to be more cautious, filled with a little self-doubt. Now, people don't always fall neatly into one camp or the other. Some of us can be both fox and hedgehog. We can think and dream big but also change course, adapt to circumstances. But it may be that we can't have our cake and eat it, too. If we want the visionary Steve Jobs who helped usher in the age of the iPhone, we might also get the tyrannical CEO who nearly ran Apple computers into the ground in the 1980s. It's odd to think of Gandhi and Napoleon and Churchill and Mao in the same breath, but they are cut from the same cloth of messianic vision. It's easy not to like the kind of people who create history's greatest failures. But it turns out they're also the people who produce our greatest triumphs.

Angela Hsieh hide caption July 15, 2019 \u2022 At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear us. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. Plus, we hear how advances in technology might help people with vocal impairments, and consider the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. Psychologist Phil Tetlock thinks the parable of the fox and the hedgehog represents two different cognitive styles. \"The hedgehogs are more the big idea people, more decisive,\" while the foxes are more accepting of nuance, more open to using different approaches with different problems. Renee Klahr hide caption July 8, 2019 \u2022 The Greek poet Archilochus wrote that \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" This week, we'll use the metaphor of the fox and the hedgehog as a way to understand the differences between tacticians and big-picture thinkers. We'll explore the story of a pioneering surgeon whose hedgehog tendencies led him to great triumphs, and a heartbreaking tragedy. This episode first aired in May 2017. July 1, 2019 \u2022 All of us are surrounded by brands. Designer brands. Bargain-shopper brands. Brands for seemingly every demographic slice among us. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself how brands influence you? This week, we look at how companies create a worldview around the products they sell, and then get us to make those products a part of who we are. June 24, 2019 \u2022 More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 \u2014 many of them from heroin and other opioids. One of the most widely-used tools to confront this crisis is a drug called naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose within seconds, and has been hailed by first responders and public health researchers. But in 2018, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior \u2014 and causing more deaths than it saves. This week, we talk with researchers, drug users, and families about the mental calculus of opioid use, and why there's still so much we're struggling to understand about addiction. This episode originally aired in October 2018. Hal Herzog, a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University, says the more we attribute humanlike qualities to animals, the more ethically problematic it may be to keep them as pets. Angela Hsieh/NPR hide caption June 17, 2019 \u2022 Does living with animals really make us healthier? Why do we eat some animals and keep others as pets? This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with psychology professor Hal Herzog about the contradictions embedded in our relationships with animals. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves \u2014 whether that is someone else with the same name or the same birthday. Renee Klahr/NPR hide caption June 10, 2019 \u2022 Are women named Virginia more likely to move to Virginia? Are people with the last name of Carpenter more likely to be carpenters? This week on Hidden Brain, we bring you a favorite 2017 episode about our preference for things that remind us of ourselves, and why this tendency can have larger implications than we might at first imagine. A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services. Angela Hsieh hide caption June 3, 2019 \u2022 Generations of Americans have struggled against segregation. Most of us believe in the ideal of a colorblind society. But what happens when that ideal come up against research that finds colorblindness sometimes leads to worse outcomes? May 27, 2019 \u2022 Many of us intuitively feel that the bitter partisanship of American politics is bad for our nation. So should we be concerned about the health of our democracy? This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit two of our favorite conversations about U.S. politics. We start by talking with political scientist John Hibbing about the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. Then, we explore the role of conflict in democracy with historian David Moss. May 20, 2019 \u2022 It happens to all of us: someone recognizes you on the street, calls you by name, and says hello. You, meanwhile, have no idea who that person is. Researchers say this struggle to read other faces is common. This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit a favorite 2016 episode about \"super-recognizers\" and the rest of us. New research suggests that early investments in children's education can have benefits that last for more than one generation. Angela Hsieh hide caption May 13, 2019 \u2022 Smarts matter. But other factors may play an even bigger role in whether someone succeeds. This week, we speak with Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman about the skills that predict how you'll fare in life. We'll also look at programs that build these skills in the neediest of children \u2013 and new research that suggests the benefits of investing in kids and families can last for generations.

Renee Klahr/NPR hide caption Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves \u2014 whether that is someone else with the same name or the same birthday. It's normal to feel drawn to people you share something with \u2014 whether that's a name, a birthday, or a shared profession. But Brett Pelham finds this preference for things and people associated with us goes far beyond what we might expect. He calls this phenomenon Implicit Egotism. \"There's at least a modest tendency for women named Georgia to gravitate towards Georgia, women named Virginia to gravitate towards Virginia, and the more closely the name resembles the state, the bigger the effect appears to be,\" Pelham says. That's not all. People who share the same birthday are slightly more likely to get married to one another. People named Carpenter are more likely to be carpenters. Those with the last name Baker are more likely to be bakers... and so on. \"We looked at every surname [...] that happens to be a career name,\" Pelham says. \"We were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a weak tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names.\" We don't just have a preference for things and people that are associated with us. We also have a preference for things that are made by us. Daniel Mochon and his colleagues have coined this the Ikea Effect. \"Imagine you built a table,\" Mochon says. \"Maybe it came out a little bit crooked. But to you that table might be really great, because you're the one who created it. It is the fruit of your labor.\" Mochon and his coauthors did a series of experiments, bringing participants into the lab, and either giving them a pre-assembled LEGO car, or LEGOs and instructions to build the car. Then they asked the volunteers \u2014 how much would you pay to keep your car? \"The students were willing to pay twice as much for the LEGO car if they just finished building it,\" Mochon says. The IKEA effect and Implicit Egotism both seem at first blush to be amusing, if not terribly significant. But Pelham and Mochon say there are all kinds of more serious implications. We tend to feel more drawn to people who are like us \u2014 and perhaps more inclined to help them. We feel more committed to our own ideas, even when they aren't necessarily our greatest ones.

Angela Hsieh hide caption New research suggests that early investments in children's education can have benefits that last for more than one generation. In the early 1990s, James Heckman traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas. He was there to see something that had been described to him as a miracle. It was a program for students who had dropped out of high school. He learned that the program took high school dropouts and converted them into high school graduates within a few months. \"I said, 'Wow, this is amazing,'\" Heckman recalls. The program that gave young people a second chance is now known widely across the country. It's called the GED. Heckman, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a Nobel laureate, wanted to know whether, on average, people with a GED were as successful as people with a high school diploma. He started by looking at their test scores. \"What really surprised me was their test scores were virtually the same,\" he says. Within a few months, the GED program was allowing students to catch up with peers who had spent years in high school. But then Heckman looked further: Were GED grads holding on to jobs? In long-term relationships? Staying out of trouble? The short answer was, no. What was going on here? Why were GED recipients struggling so much more as adults if they had the same test scores as high school graduates?

Doerschlag began to recognize his talent well into adulthood, after a series of strange encounters and sightings. There was the man he recognized in the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, someone he'd sat behind three years earlier at a Michigan vs. Ohio State football game. (Doerschlag remembered the man but not the score of the game.) There were the company Christmas parties where he could always remember exactly who was whose spouse. And there was the time he asked a waiter serving him in a Las Vegas restaurant if he'd also served tables many years earlier at a particular restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. \"The guy just froze,\" says Julie Doerschlag, Marty's wife, who was with him for all of these incidents. \"It was probably 15 years before. And [the waiter] said, 'Yeah, you're right.'\" But here's the thing. Just as some humans are spectacularly skilled at recognizing faces, others are completely incompetent. \"I think nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces,\" says Mike Burton, a professor of psychology at the University of York UK. Burton has run a number of facial recognition studies and has concluded that most people are remarkably bad at recognizing the faces of those they know only slightly. And to make matters worse, most people think they are good at this skill when they are not. This week on Hidden Brain, stories of super-recognizers...and the rest of us.

        "texts": "Shankar Vedantam Jennifer Schmidt Tara Boyle Parth Shah Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a stunning statistic. Seventy-two thousand people, it estimates, died of drug overdoses in 2017. The huge increase in deaths is largely due to heroin and powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl. One of the tools being used to fight that wave of deaths is the drug naloxone. It's been called the Lazarus drug for its ability to revive people dying from overdoses. It can be injected or simply administered through a nasal spray. (The spray form of the drug is known by the brand name Narcan.) Twenty-four-year-old Tiffany \u2014 whose last name is being withheld to protect her privacy \u2014 owes her life to naloxone. \"I've overdosed nine times,\" she says. Each time she overdosed, Tiffany was revived with naloxone. Another heroin user, James, says he has also been brought back with naloxone, and that he's used the drug on friends who \"fall out,\" or lose consciousness. \"I've got five or six nasal spray Narcans up in my room, so if someone else falls out around me, when you shoot it up their nose, not even ten, fifteen seconds later, they are back,\" he says. Tiffany and James say naloxone has not changed the way they think about heroin, but both have friends who treat naloxone like a safety net. Tiffany says she has one friend who assumes that \"if he overdoses, someone will come give him Narcan and bring him back.\" But would her friend stop using heroin if he didn't have Narcan? \"No,\" she says. \"There ain't no way.\" The possibility that naloxone might lead to greater risk taking among drug users prompted two economists to study the issue. Their controversial and hotly-debated findings suggest naloxone not only increases risky drug use but may actually cause more deaths than it saves. Public health researchers say these findings are based on flawed data and analyses. This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with users, families, and researchers about risky drug use. We'll try to understand the complex risk/benefit calculations involved in opioid use, and why there's still so much we're struggling to understand about addiction. Editor's Note: In this story, Jasmine Pierce, an overdose response coordinator for the Anne Arundel County Department of Health, says that county officials \"provide gloves inside of the kits... to protect you from any type of contamination because, with both of those drugs, they can actually seep through your skin with skin-to-skin contact, and you can overdose yourself.\" Here's what the CDC has to say about the risks of opioid exposure to first responders: \"Fentanyl and its analogues pose a potential hazard to a variety of responders who could come into contact with these drugs in the course of their work. Possible exposure routes to fentanyl and its analogues can vary based on the source and form of the drug. Responders are most likely to encounter illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues in powder, tablet, and liquid form. Potential exposure routes of greatest concern include inhalation, mucous membrane contact, ingestion, and percutaneous exposure (e.g., needlestick). Any of these exposure routes can potentially result in a variety of symptoms that can include the rapid onset of life-threatening respiratory depression. Skin contact is also a potential exposure route, but is not likely to lead to overdose unless large volumes of highly concentrated powder are encountered over an extended period of time. Brief skin contact with fentanyl or its analogues is not expected to lead to toxic effects if any visible contamination is promptly removed. There are no established federal or consensus occupational exposure limits for fentanyl or its analogues.\" You can also read this statement from the American College of Medical Toxicologists, which says that \"the risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low.\" Additional Resources: The Moral Hazard of Lifesaving Innovations: Naloxone, Access, Opioid Abuse, and Crime, by Jennifer L.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. There is comfort in the familiar. That's why Marlon Wade (ph) likes to head over to his local barbershop, Wrist Action. MARLON WADE: I just stop in. VEDANTAM: It's on MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland, Calif. He doesn't come for a cut. WADE: No hair, no hair. I just wear the bald head. VEDANTAM: He comes to shoot the breeze. WADE: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah, yeah. VEDANTAM: He points to one of the barbers, who's a friend. WADE: That's my son's godfather. That's one of my old school teammates. We played baseball together. VEDANTAM: Basically, Marlon likes to hang with people who know and understand him, people he grew up with. WADE: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: Some years ago, when Marlon was in the market for a new doctor, he looked for that same feeling of connection. WADE: I have various choices. I had, like - I had over 20 doctors to choose from. VEDANTAM: But one stood out. She was, like him, black and, like him, a practicing Muslim. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: It's the kind of trusting relationship Marlon doesn't believe he'd find in a doctor of a different race. WADE: I don't think a lot of these doctors relate to people of my skin color. Like, when it comes to heart disease, diabetes, like, a lot of these diseases can be researched and medically something done for it. But at the end of the day, my community not getting that service. VEDANTAM: A variety of studies do suggest that black men in America often receive inferior care compared to white patients. They have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group. Many of the diseases they're dying from are chronic or preventable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now a growing body of research suggests Marlon Wade might be onto something in his choice of doctor. OWEN GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively the patients to take more of the preventative services compared to the nonblack doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we considered a simple but controversial way to improve outcomes in medicine, education and other fields. And we ask, what happens when the ideal of a colorblind society runs into hard evidence that you may get better outcomes by not being colorblind? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Where Owen Garrick was a kid growing up in the South Bronx, he lived across the street from a bunch of relatives, including his Uncle Bobby. GARRICK: So he was the one that you could always hang out with, to the mall or to the store or to some friend's house. You can go swimming with him. He's a guy you can just jump in his car, come back at all hours of the evening, and he was your excuse, right? You know, Mom, Uncle Bobby let - you know, had me staying out all night. VEDANTAM: But when he was 66 years old, Uncle Bobby found out he was dying of prostate cancer. GARRICK: So he started having bone pain due to the metastases to his bone, and that brought him - and the pain brought him in. And so then he was diagnosed. He probably died a few months after he was diagnosed. VEDANTAM: In Owen's opinion, it was a preventable death. Prostate cancer is usually slow growing. It's easy to detect. GARRICK: He could still be very much alive and still very much active in his community and with his family but unfortunately wouldn't go in for his preventative services. VEDANTAM: Owen says many of the older men in his family were the same way. They didn't trust doctors. They didn't get preventative care. This is the kind of story told over and over again in black America. And it's a story reflected in a grim statistic. The average life expectancy of black men is 72 years - about four years shorter than the average for white men. GARRICK: It's not just prostate cancer. It's cardiovascular disease, stroke. It's diabetes. Most of the death is due to preventable or chronic conditions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is something Owen wants to change. He's a doctor and researcher. He runs Bridge Clinical Research, a company whose mission is to make the medical system work better for black Americans. Owen is tired of the bad news about black men and health care in America. He's tired of talking about the disparity in health outcomes. What Owen wants is a fix, a way to get black men, particularly low-income black men, to go to the doctor for preventative care. He wants doctors who will listen to patients and patients who will listen to doctors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So Owen and his fellow researchers, Marcella Alsan and Grant Graziani, designed a field study to try to answer one simple question. GARRICK: Will black men take more preventative care services if they're randomly assigned to a black doctor? VEDANTAM: Is it possible that the race of your physician matters in terms of your own health? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: To find out, Owen and his colleagues rented a medical clinic in Oakland. They recruited 14 black and nonblack doctors to staff the clinic during the study. For patients, they turned to flea markets and barbershops in and around the East Bay, places like Wrist Action where Marlon Wade likes to hang out. GARRICK: And if you go to a black barbershop, you will have all sorts of black men in the barbershop. WADE: Not much, but how you doin'? GARRICK: You'll have folks who - like me. You'll have my kids at that barbershop. You'll have folks who didn't graduate from high school and their kids. VEDANTAM: The first step was asking patrons in these places if they'd answer some basic questions. Some 1,300 men agreed to fill out a short survey about their socioeconomic status, health history and level of trust in the medical system. For these efforts, they received cash or a voucher for a free haircut plus a coupon for a free health screening. About half the men showed up at the clinic for that screening. Before their checkup, the clinic staff showed the men a picture of the doctor they'd been randomly assigned. They also asked them to select from a list of preventative care services that they'd be willing to receive. GARRICK: Height and weight to check body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, which was total cholesterol and a diabetes screen, which is hemoglobin A1c. VEDANTAM: At first, the men made similar choices. GARRICK: They all accepted generally the same level of preventative services. VEDANTAM: In other words, seeing the photos of the doctors did not change patients' decisions about what services to accept. Typically, the men would choose some of the services but not all. They might agree to get their body mass index and blood pressure checked but forgo the tests for diabetes and cholesterol that come with a needle stick. But what happened next changed their choices. GARRICK: The doctor then comes in and says, OK, Mr. Smith, you've only selected these three. You know, you've only selected height and weight and blood pressure. We really recommend that you take all five because they're all recommended. They're all good for your health. VEDANTAM: As I said, some of the black patients were randomized to receive this advice from a black doctor, some from a nonblack doctor. Did the race of the physician affect what patients did? GARRICK: The black doctors were able to convince more effectively of the patients to take more of the preventative services. VEDANTAM: And not just by a little - by a lot. The black doctors were about 20% more successful than nonblack doctors at getting patients to have their blood pressure and body mass measured. They were even more effective at persuading their patients to have invasive tests. For diabetes and the flu shot, the black doctors were about 50% more successful than nonblack doctors. And then came the cholesterol results. GARRICK: There was a 72% difference in the ability of the black doctor to recommend and have the black male patient take cholesterol screening compared to the nonblack doctor. VEDANTAM: Seventy-two percent. Now, the real-life implications of these results might be significant. High cholesterol, for instance, can lead to heart attacks, strokes. What if black patients in the real world responded to their physicians like their counterparts in the study? Owen Garrick says the gap in the United States between blacks and whites in cardiovascular disease outcomes might shrink by nearly 20%. GARRICK: That could be 20% of the people living to see their grandkids graduate from college and high school, right? That's how I think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF SIR EDWARD ELGAR'S \"POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE\") VEDANTAM: These results suggest they might be an easy, low-cost way to save the lives of black men. Owen and his colleagues wanted to understand what was going on. Why were the black doctors so much more effective? The researchers didn't think prejudice was at play because the patients rated all the physicians, black and nonblack, as equally good. But then they discovered a clue. It was in the notes the doctors had written about their patients. GARRICK: We found that the black doctors actually wrote more notes compared to the nonblack doctors about their patients. And often, those notes talked about their non-health care issues - a wedding is coming up; will the Warriors repeat as NBA champions? Like, so nonmedical issues. VEDANTAM: The black doctors and black patients were connecting as human beings. They were talking about family, sports, life. It's the kind of chitchat that says, I know where you're coming from. I hear you. Marlon Wade from the barbershop made the very same point about his doctor. WADE: She gets me. I get her. We talk about life. We talk about our religion. You know, if something wrong with me, she going to let me know. VEDANTAM: Owen's research is part of a growing body of work that suggests matching patients and doctors by race can make a difference in health outcomes. In another study, researchers found that Florida patients assigned to physicians of their own race were 13% less likely to die while in the hospital. These results were driven almost entirely by black patients matched with black physicians. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: The research raises difficult questions about our medical system, our society and our biases. The clearest takeaway from the research is that warm and empathetic communication matters. Owen Garrick believes that doctors might be taught to bridge some of the differences he observed in his study. GARRICK: Because if communication is the mechanism, you can train - or you should be able to train nonblack doctors to more effectively communicate with their patients. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There is a more daunting takeaway. If you want better outcomes in health care, especially among the most vulnerable patients, having a more diverse pool of physicians is crucial. Owen says what he wants is for patients to have a choice. If they want to see a black doctor, they can choose one. But right now, that's often not possible. GARRICK: Four percent of physicians are black. Blacks represent 13% of the U.S. population. So an underrepresentation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: It's important to note that choice is not just something blacks might prefer. In a follow-up survey, Owen and his team found that both black and white respondents indicated a same-race preference. Sixty-five percent of blacks surveyed said a black doctor would better understand their concerns. Seventy percent of whites said a white doctor would better understand them. There is a third implication of Owen's research, and it feels radioactive. Given the results, I asked him, should hospitals and medical centers match patients and doctors by race, particularly when it comes to black men? Owen challenged the notion that this needed to be a radioactive idea. GARRICK: Fraternities and sororities self-select by gender. You could argue that that's segregation. I wouldn't argue that that's segregation. But, you know, someone might. You know, a pessimist might. And I think in - the pessimists of the world might argue that recommending black physicians for black patients is segregation. I don't see it that way. VEDANTAM: Still, Owen acknowledges he would be uncomfortable with the idea that hospitals would deliberately steer black patients to black doctors and white patients to white doctors. After all, we struggled as a nation for decades to overcome segregation. How would patients react if they were told when they showed up at a clinic, you're black so we're sending you to the black doctor? There is some tension here, right? Because there are two values, I think, that are in conflict with one another here. I mean, there is one value that basically says, you know, we should all essentially treat one another the same. We should all get along well. We should all, you know, as Dr. King would say, look at each other's character and abilities and not the color of our skin or our gender. I mean, so that is an ideal. And the other ideal is we should trust the data, and we should trust the evidence and we should follow where the evidence leads. And it feels like those two values, following the evidence and the data and following this norm that we have about how we'd like our society to be, these two values are in conflict. GARRICK: Right. And they're partly in conflict because we don't live in an ideal world. And some might argue, skeptics of the world might argue, that we profess to live in an ideal world when we know absolutely the world is not ideal. So given that, given the cards you're dealt, the life you live, the world we exist in, how do you best, in our case, accomplish, improve health outcomes for all populations - and specifically in our research study, the black male population? And this issue of the race of the doctor seems to work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: And it isn't just in medicine. When we come back, the results of matching people by their identities from education, to retail, to banking. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In 1985, researchers in Tennessee launched a massive experiment to see if class sizes affected learning. There was plenty of anecdotal evidence at the time suggesting that kids did better in smaller classes, but there was no hard data to prove it. Project STAR changed that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: More than 11,000 students from kindergarten through third grade were randomly assigned to one of three class-size groups. Researchers tracked their performance over time. The experiment is now considered one of the most important education studies ever conducted. It showed that smaller class sizes led to substantial improvements in early learning, especially for minority students. In the decades since, researchers have also come to realize the random placement of kids in Project STAR could be used to study something else. CONSTANCE LINDSAY: If you are randomizing by class size, you are also randomizing by teacher race. VEDANTAM: This is Constance Lindsay. She is an education professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. She said this insight led to a new research question. Do children who have a teacher of the same race do better than children who don't? Education researcher Thomas Dee was the first to analyze the Project STAR data in this new way. Did students do better if they were matched with a teacher of the same race? In 2004, he published his findings. Constance says they were striking. LINDSAY: If you're a black student and you have a black teacher, on average, you're going to have a higher test score than a black student who has a white teacher. VEDANTAM: The findings weren't just specific to black kids. They also held true for white students. Both black and white kids did better on math and reading achievement tests if they had a teacher of the same race. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Thomas Dee worried that his results might cause people to call for increased racial segregation in schools. He felt that would be a mistake. He first noted that his results only apply to how kids were doing during the four-year experiment. The results did not predict achievement over longer time periods. Second, he felt the best takeaway would be more study. He urged researchers to continue exploring why race dynamics matter in the classroom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Fourteen years later, Constance Lindsay and her colleagues did just that. LINDSAY: Basically, what we did is we said let's use the fact that we can follow the students over many, many years and see what happens to them in terms of high school dropout, whether they take a college entrance exam, and then whether they enroll in college. VEDANTAM: In other words, they tried to answer the open question Thomas Dee had raised, do black children who are randomly assigned to black teachers perform better over the long term? What they found is those early interactions had a lasting effect. LINDSAY: Black students in our sample who were matched to a black teacher were less likely to drop out of high school, more likely to sit for a college entrance exam - so think, you know, SAT, ACT - and then more likely to enroll in college. VEDANTAM: The success of black students increased with every year they were matched with black teachers. Black students who spent more time with black teachers did better than black students who spent less time. These results could have huge implications. They suggest that race matching might be one way to get more at-risk black kids to stay in school and go on to higher education. Of course, Tennessee is just one state, and researchers wanted to make sure they weren't looking at a one-state phenomenon. So they turned to North Carolina. This state has a huge public school database. It contains all kinds of information about students, including their demographics, the classes they've taken and the race of various teachers over the years. Again, the researchers looked at kids in elementary school and then tracked them over time. Now, these kids weren't randomly matched like they were in Tennessee, but still, they had exposure to black and nonblack teachers. Constance says the results told the same story. Black kids who had had black teachers were less likely to drop out of high school. LINDSAY: And then when you finish high school in North Carolina, there's a survey you fill out that says, I will attend college, I will not attend college. It's basically, like, an intent-to-attend-college measure. And we find that more black students who are matched to black teachers report wanting to attend college. VEDANTAM: Students who benefited the most from having a black teacher were those most at risk of dropping out, low-income black boys. The North Carolina data showed that these boys were 39% less likely to drop out of high school if they had a black teacher in elementary school - 39%. What Constance and her colleagues were seeing in education is what Owen Garrick saw in medicine - race matters. Now, we don't know why these black teachers were making such a difference in the lives of their black students, but the researchers think a variety of forces might be at work. One could be implicit bias. Teachers may hold unconscious prejudices that negatively affect black students. LINDSAY: That prevent them from, you know, maybe identifying kids for things like gifted programs or enacting harsher discipline punishments. VEDANTAM: Constance says black teachers also serve as powerful role models for black students. LINDSAY: The presence of, you know, a college-educated adult in your life makes a difference. VEDANTAM: And then there's what's called cultural competence. LINDSAY: Which is that teachers are able to read behavior better if you sort of share - you know, if you have cultural things that you share in common. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This seems especially true in the area of discipline. In another research project, Constance and her colleagues have found that one reason black boys sometimes get into trouble at school is because of something researchers call willful defiance. LINDSAY: Willful defiance is, I get into an argument with the teacher and, you know, maybe I talk back, or something along those lines, and then you have to go to the principal's office. VEDANTAM: And so what do you see with willful defiance? LINDSAY: So we see that the drops in willful defiance are huge when you have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: But just as there's a shortage of black doctors in America, there's also a shortage of black teachers. Nationwide, teachers in elementary and secondary schools are overwhelmingly white despite growing racial diversity among students. LINDSAY: So for example, in the North Carolina data, both in the long-term study and in the discipline study that I have, over 50% of the black students never have a black teacher. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: On a very personal level, Constance knows well the lasting impression a black teacher can leave on students. LINDSAY: 'Cause my grandmother was a teacher here in D.C. public schools for a very long time. VEDANTAM: Constance describes her as a warm demander. LINDSAY: This is someone who is - you know, sort of holds you accountable for the things that you should be doing, but does it in a warm fashion. VEDANTAM: Her name was Mae Wilson (ph). DONALD WILLIAMS: Mae Wilson. Well, dealing with her, she was stern. She kept an orderly classroom. She was the boss, you know? VEDANTAM: This is Donald Williams (ph). He's in his late 60s and has lived nearly all his life in Washington, D.C. In the early 1970s, Don was a student at a school that has educated generations of African-American students, Dunbar High School. This is where Mae Wilson taught. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOK PAGES TURNING) WILLIAMS: Man, it's been a long time since I looked in this book. VEDANTAM: From an old yearbook... WILLIAMS: Wow. VEDANTAM: ...Don points to his younger self, a star football player at Dunbar. WILLIAMS: Here, I was blocking. There, I was running with the football. There, I was running with the football. There, I got tackled. VEDANTAM: Most of Don's memories from high school revolve around football. Except for that homeroom teacher, Mae Wilson, whom he's never forgotten. WILLIAMS: She's, like, 5'5\", 5'4\", but her demeanor was bigger than that, you know? She didn't take a lot of, you know, nonsense. You knew it. You knew. She was like your mother away from home. But she didn't take any stuff. She didn't cut any corners. VEDANTAM: Don says there was something about Mae Wilson that made you pay attention. Maybe it was the tailored skirt suit she wore, or her air of authority. WILLIAMS: She always looked business. She always looked business. She never came in a nightclub dress, or something like that. She always looked professional. So that's another message that you saw in her, that she was - she'd stick to the rules of being on time, doing things that you need to do, not being rowdy, controlling yourself in public. VEDANTAM: Her lessons ultimately stuck and became life lessons for Don. I asked him if it made a difference to him that Mae Wilson was black. He told me the question was a no-brainer - yes, of course, it made a difference. WILLIAMS: As a black kid, you can relate better when you see someone in the position that you're in 'cause if you're not black, you can't understand what I'm saying. You can - yeah, you can say it 'cause it's the right thing - oh, I under - no. You don't. You couldn't possibly know. 'Cause you're not black. VEDANTAM: Don has the same feeling about his football coaches. He says shared identity often led to trust. WILLIAMS: Like I said, a kid needs to see someone who's been there. It's easy for you to talk it when you got it. It's easy for a rich man to tell you to save your money. He got money. How can a rich man tell a poor man what's going on, what life is about? It's got to be someone that knows the avenues to go to that someone that's black that's been through it. You know, you got to - and then, you know, that's his ticket. That's his motivation there to show you what's - how it can be done. VEDANTAM: Giving students the feeling that they are understood by their teachers, who can say this is a bad idea? But if you zoom out, putting this idea into practice runs into all sorts of problems related to history, politics and optics. I asked Constance Lindsay about this. Let's say you're the principal of a school, and you have one black teacher in second grade, and you have, let's say, 15 black students spread across five sections of second grade. Would you assign all those 15 students to the black teacher? LINDSAY: I probably would not do that. If I had students that in that particular set of 15 that were particularly disadvantaged, I might. I might also explore ways in which teachers could co-teach so that, you know, all of those 15 students would have the opportunity to interact with that teacher. But I definitely wouldn't advocate sort of segregating them into one class. VEDANTAM: Why not? That's what your data show works. LINDSAY: That is what the data show that works. But I think we agreed that segregation is bad. VEDANTAM: But I think this is what makes the paper really, really tricky, which is it's actually suggesting that's something that we thought was a good thing might have an outcome that is not such a good thing. LINDSAY: That's right. That's right. So I guess if you held a gun to my head and you said I had to pick between segregating students and, you know, making sure that students had a black teacher, I would pick that they had a black teacher. VEDANTAM: So you actually would put the students in the same class then? LINDSAY: If you said I had to. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: No, I guess what I'm asking you is not so much whether I have to but, you know, if you looked at the data and said that you are improving the odds of students by 10, 15, maybe 20%, and you did not do that thing that could improve their odds by 10, 15, 20%, I mean, that is immoral. LINDSAY: You could say that. You could say that. I mean, if I were a parent of a black boy, and there was one black male teacher in the school, I would go tell the principal to assign my child to him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There is some evidence the race-matching effects we see in medicine and education also show up in other spheres. At Temple University, Derek Avery and his colleagues found that customers at a retail store who interacted with sales agents of the same race had higher levels of satisfaction. This was especially true in areas where racial minorities were a larger share of the customer base. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Columbia University's Raymond Fisman found in a study conducted in India that ethnic and religious matching between bankers and customers increased the likelihood of loans being repaid. It also lowered the cost of loans because banks perceived there was a lower risk in lending money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Other workers observed that gender can act in similar ways to racial or religious identification. Brad Greenwood at the University of Minnesota found that more women in Florida survived a heart attack when their doctor was a woman rather than a man. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: At the University of Massachusetts, social psychologist Nilanjana Dasgupta has found that female students in calculus classes were more engaged in the subject when they had a female professor rather than a male professor. NILANJANA DASGUPTA: Just having a female professor ends up making women feel they'll do better in the class or making them feel more confident, making them feel that they care more about math than when the same course material, same exam, same syllabus is taught by a male professor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is important because calculus is a gateway class to degrees in careers in math and science, where women are currently underrepresented. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There are three lessons from all these examples. The first is that we really need doctors and teachers and loan officers and store clerks from different races and different backgrounds. It can have tangible and measurable outcomes. The second lesson is that if we want to be understood by people who are different from us in some way, it's going to take work. You can't just assume that your job begins and ends with teaching a course or diagnosing the patient. You have to make a connection with the human being across from you. The final lesson has to do with a seemingly contradictory effect of diversity. In an earlier episode of HIDDEN BRAIN, The Edge Effect, we talked about how diversity boosts creativity and innovation. By contrast, here we've seen how connecting with people who are like us can produce better outcomes. One explanation for this contradiction lies in what you are trying to achieve. You want novelty and creativity? Those flourish from bringing together different perspectives. But if you want trust and communication, those come easier when we have things in common. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Jenny Schmidt and Parth Shah. It was edited by Tara Boyle and Rhaina Cohen. Our team includes Laura Kwerel and Thomas Lu. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Our Unsung Hero this week is Jeff Rogers. Jeff helps to run two of our sister NPR shows, the TED Radio Hour and How I Built This. He played an early role in helping get HIDDEN BRAIN off the ground. He's also the kind of person you want to have when things are changing quickly around you. Jeff can be coach, friend and taskmaster. He has an uncanny ability to stay calm, which is why so many people say whenever they have a problem, I'm sure Jeff can help with that.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We start today with an account of two communities. One is liberal, the other conservative. I want you to guess which is which. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JOHN HIBBING: The schools would stress patriotism and respect, and it would be a very rules-based educational system. The houses would be fairly similar. The lawns would be very nicely kept and beautifully green and mowed. The town would be quiet, with lots of churches. VEDANTAM: That's Town 1. Here's Town 2. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HIBBING: The schools would be based more on experiential kinds of things rather than rote memory. People would prefer older houses with wooden floors rather than wall-to-wall carpeting. They would keep the yards natural - lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films, more of those than churches. VEDANTAM: That was easy, right? Conservatives like order. Liberals embrace ambiguity. Now, you may be rolling your eyes or even getting angry at these stereotypes. But we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them. So how did these two towns, which our guest today refers to as Liberalville (ph) and Conservaton (ph), get this way? When most of us think about how we came to our political views, we tend to have a straightforward explanation. We use our upbringing and life experiences as the basis for our political beliefs. We imagine that our parents, teachers and friends shape our views on everything, from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security. But what if I told you there is something deeper to those attitudes - drives that shape the music we listen to, the food we eat, the politicians we elect? This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences, but from biology. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: On a regular basis, right before an election, someone will share an article with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted. Or a post on Twitter will say, Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats. These claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate. There are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. Understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts. John Hibbing is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He has spent many years studying the psychological and neurological differences between liberals and conservatives. He is co-author of the book, \"Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, And The Biology Of Political Differences.\" John, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. HIBBING: Thank you, Shankar. Pleasure to be with you. VEDANTAM: When most of us think about how we came to our political views, John, we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background. How does that theory go? HIBBING: Well, whenever I ask my students where their political views come from, the first thing they say is their parents. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HIBBING: And I think we have this sense that those views that our parents have passed along are supplemented by those, you know, from a clergy member or a trusted relative, a close friend. But we sort those through our own view of the world, and we come to a very rational understanding of the world and an understanding of what social policies are best to make the world better. VEDANTAM: So we're going to look in-depth at some of the psychological and brain differences that do exist between liberals and conservatives. But I want to start by looking at how differences between partisans are not limited to politics. These differences show up in many domains that have nothing to do with politics. Republican President George H. W. Bush once spoke about an issue that had bothered him for many years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE H. W. BUSH: I do not like broccoli. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm president of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli. VEDANTAM: What do food differences tell us about liberals and conservatives? HIBBING: Well, we tend to see that there are differences in tastes. Conservatives do like meat and potatoes more. Liberals are more likely to prefer ethnic food. So you see that. And that, we think, is part of a deeper pattern of conservatives are a little bit fonder of kind of predictability, of standard kinds of things. And liberals are a little bit more willing to experiment. And this comes through in food tastes and a variety of other things. VEDANTAM: Here's another example. Researchers once went into the living spaces of people - offices and dorm rooms. And they recorded the items that they saw. What was different about the living and workspaces of liberals and conservatives? HIBBING: Well, conservatives tended to have lots of things like sports memorabilia, whereas liberals tended to have more experiential things - lots of books, lots of CDs, especially diverse CDs, whereas conservatives were more likely to have things that organized their lives - calendars, clothes baskets. Also, the researchers suggested the liberals' rooms were not quite as tidy or as well-lighted as the conservative rooms and offices. VEDANTAM: There's even been some research looking at differences in our preferences for different kinds of pets. I understand Jonathan Haidt and others have explored that liberals and conservatives gravitate to different kinds of dogs. HIBBING: Different kinds of dogs - it tends to be the case that conservatives prefer purebreds. And liberals will go with mixed-breed dogs. There are some studies that suggest how you view pets - there isn't that much difference in how many have pets. Both liberals and conservatives like to have pets at about equal level. But they might view them somewhat differently. Liberals are a little bit more likely to view them as part of the family rather than, you know, just a pet. So you have those kinds of very interesting things, not just in pet ownership, but kind of in orientation to the pet. VEDANTAM: The patterns that John and others have identified are more than just curious. These patterns suggest that our model of political differences is wrong in an important way. Liberals and conservatives don't just have different political preferences. They have different temperaments. Conservatives don't just care about lower taxes. They also care about whether poetry rhymes. HIBBING: That's right. Should poetry rhyme? We also ask - you know, are you more comfortable with novels that end with clear resolution? - those kinds of things. And you know, you can start to see a pattern already, I think, in our discussion, that it is the case that liberals are more likely to say, sure, I'm OK with free verse, whereas conservatives say, no, you know, we really think there should be a pattern - music should come back to a recognizable melody, poetry should rhyme, and novels should wrap up in a way that we are comfortable with. VEDANTAM: To be clear, the differences John identifies are averages. So you can certainly have a Republican who likes free verse and a Democrat who hates jazz. The point of this research isn't to stereotype liberals and conservatives but to show that our political choices flow from deeply ingrained psychological differences. Many of us don't realize how our choices as consumers - the cars we buy, the food we eat, the music we listen to - that these choices inadvertently reveal our political preferences. So I'm happy to tell people on Facebook what kind of music I listen to, but I imagine that they wouldn't be able to tell from that whether I was a Democrat or a Republican. I asked John about research that suggests you can tell whether someone's a conservative or a liberal if you know what kind of movies they watch, what kind of food they eat, what kind of vacations they take. HIBBING: It's very reasonable that people would not resonate with that line of argument because, to them, it's not like they say, well, you know, in order to be a good conservative, I need to do this - or in order to be a good liberal. So you know, they're just being themselves. And I think that's the real message here, is that our political beliefs are part and parcel of our entire being. You know, it's not like they're completely separate. And it's just a natural outgrowth of these larger psychological and even physiological tendencies that we've been talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Liberals and conservatives differ when it comes to how they see threats and danger. Here's Wayne LaPierre, the former head of the National Rifle Association. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WAYNE LAPIERRE: We know, in the world that surrounds us, there are terrorists and there are home invaders, drug cartels, carjackers, knockout gamers and rapers and haters and campus killers, airport killers, shopping mall killers... VEDANTAM: So talk about this difference, John. When liberals hear this, what do they hear? When conservatives hear this, what do they hear? HIBBING: Yeah, it really is a remarkable quote. I remember Jon Stewart played this once on \"The Daily Show.\" And after the clip, they pan back to Stewart... (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\") JON STEWART: Where the [expletive] do you live? (LAUGHTER) HIBBING: ...And he was hiding behind his desk. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HIBBING: So you know, you get the sense that if you listen to this very long, you're scared of everything. The message that I take from this is that, you know, you play this to liberals and they say, this guy is nuts. You know, others have told me he's just doing it because he makes millions of dollars from the NRA and he doesn't really believe it. I think he does. These threats are very real to him, and we're not going to get anywhere unless people who don't feel that way understand that some people do. And likewise, the Wayne LaPierres of the world need to understand that for some people, they just - you know, they don't see the world as threatening as he does. And they don't think we need to build our society around mitigating those threats. VEDANTAM: So you know, when a liberal like Jon Stewart hides behind the desk, partly what he's doing is he's mocking a Wayne LaPierre. He's sort of saying, this is ridiculous. It's beyond ridiculous to imagine that all these threats are basically around us. We live in a relatively safe society. And basically, what Jon Stewart is communicating is, you know, what you're saying doesn't make any sense. And what you're saying is, it might not make sense to you, but it makes sense to Wayne LaPierre. HIBBING: Exactly. You know, one of the favorite things for conservatives to say about liberals is that they just don't get it - meaning that, you know, they don't appreciate that it's a dangerous world. And I think that is absolutely true. But it's not that they don't get it because they're being obtuse or they're not informed. They read about events in the world, and they just don't respond to them in the same way. And likewise con - liberals, rather, need to recognize that while this may seem silly - and you're right about Jon Stewart mocking this - you know, how can you live your life worried and whatever? But to them, this is very real and a good citizen is vigilant and is prepared to do battle to protect himself, his family and society from those threats. VEDANTAM: What's interesting about both groups here is that there is a very powerful illusion that we have that the rest of the world sees the world the way that we see the world. And if they come to a different conclusion, it must be because they're being deliberately obtuse or somehow deliberately biased, as opposed to the idea that people are actually - they might be seeing the world the same way, but their reactions to world might actually be very different. HIBBING: Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up. Psychologists talk about false consensus. So it turns out that if your favorite color is blue, you grossly overstate the percent of the population whose favorite color is blue. So you know, I think we need to recognize that. We did a study once. There's a substance, androsterone - it turns out that people smell it very differently. It's just because our olfactory systems are structured differently. Some people smell it very favorably. It smells like kind of cookies or incense. Others smell it unfavorably. It'll smell like sweat or even urine. And some don't smell it at all. And it's a genetically based difference. So we had a bunch of our graduate students smell this. And I remember one fellow, and he smelled it, and it just smelled awful to him. And it didn't smell awful to many of the other graduate students. And he was convinced that this was some kind of psychological trick, that we were trying to, you know, get him to say, well, yeah, it doesn't smell bad, it was one of those studies - when in fact, he just couldn't believe that people were that different in the way they smelled this substance. And I think the same thing applies to political beliefs and to the way we experience threats in the world. VEDANTAM: I remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard the word laurel... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Laurel. VEDANTAM: ...Or heard the word yanny (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Laurel. VEDANTAM: But this idea that, you know, the way that we see, hear, something must be the way everyone else sees it. And there's just this feeling of utter disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way. HIBBING: Yeah. It's just what we're used to. It makes sense to us. So I do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on - that we really are wired up quite differently. VEDANTAM: Let's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration. Here is Republican Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. VEDANTAM: And here is Democrat Nancy Pelosi. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: We are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country. Their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream, which drew them here in the first place, strengthens the American dream. VEDANTAM: Now, it's important to stipulate here, John, that it's entirely possible - these are politicians. They might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic. But how might differences in threat perception shape the way liberals and conservatives, in general, think about the subject of immigration? HIBBING: Yeah, I really think - you know, immigration, defense, police, law and order - I think this is really at the core of who we are and at the core of political differences. So you know, if I am a person like Wayne LaPierre who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us, then it seems to me I would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helped to reduce those threats. And how am I going to do this? I'm going to do it by allowing people to be well-armed. I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense. I'm going to empower police. I'm going to have the death penalty, and I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here. Or if they do, they are going to be extremely vetted, as the president's once said. So you know, those, I think, to a threat-sensitive mindset, are steps that - you know, they only make sense. They just can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Now, there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual world, political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits. But John and others have studied these differences in experimental settings. John once showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures, and he found they reacted very differently. HIBBING: A positive picture would be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope, a happy child. A negative picture would be things like a house that had just been leveled by a hurricane or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished. We had people hooked up to some physiological devices. The most obvious one is electrodermal activity or skin conductance, which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction - having a physiological arousal to that stimulus. And what we found is that people do have arousals when they see these kinds of images because they have some emotional content. But we tended to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images, and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images. VEDANTAM: I understand that in one brain imaging study that you conducted, volunteers were shown disgusting images. And brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative. HIBBING: That's true. There have been three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different. And the one that we did goes back to kind of our favorite thing, which is to show them these different kinds of pictures. Actually, we had the most luck with pictures of mutilations. And you're right. When we did that, it was very easy to categorize people, you know, without knowing anything about them. All we would look at was the brain scan results. And we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they were liberal or conservative just on the basis of that. Liberals' brains, when they looked at mutilation images, were much more active in a part of the brain called the S2, somatosensory 2. And this is part of the brain that will be activated if you suffer pain. So if I kick you in the shin, your somatosensory 2 would be active. But it's also active if you see pain in others. And so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rusty nail - goes right through their foot - your somatosensory 2 would be active. And what we saw in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation in the somatosensory 2 than conservatives. Doesn't mean that conservatives are hard-hearted; it just means that things are happening differently when they see these different images. VEDANTAM: Now, you could argue that a lot of this research is correlational. You could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences. Here's how. Let's say I'm raised in a conservative home. I learned to be politically conservative from my parents, but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics. They shape the kind of food I like to eat, the kind of movies I like to watch, the kind of sports I enjoy. By this line of reasoning, the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things isn't about biology. It just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment. Think about fraternal and identical twins. Identical twins have identical genes. Fraternal twins have similar but not identical genes. If you follow a group of fraternal and identical twins, each twin pair is raised in the same household. Each pair eats the same food, listens to the same conversations, watches the same movies. Now, if you find differences between identical twins as a group and fraternal twins as a group, that suggests that biology, not environment, is the driver. I asked John what such studies reveal about political preferences. HIBBING: We were fortunate to have access to a data set. It's very large - includes thousands and thousands of twin pairs, collected by a guy named Lindon Eaves long ago. It's a fairly dated data set. But it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views. And when we subjected these data to the standard twin design approach, we did indeed find that the - political views were quite heritable. Although people oftentimes misread this, our results suggested that maybe 30 or 40% of our political views come from genetics. But you know, that bothered a lot of people, and this was quite a controversial study in political science. Many people didn't like that at all. And they tended to overinterpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was genetic. But you know, if it's 30 to 40% genetic, that obviously leaves, you know, 50, 60, 70% that comes from the environment. So all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero. But apparently, that was enough that some people were upset about that. VEDANTAM: And so you basically - you're able to tell, in some ways, that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins than in the political orientation of fraternal twins. And that tells you that there is some element of the biology, some element of genetics, that is driving political preferences. HIBBING: Exactly. Now, that's well put. And again, it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things. Height, for example, turns out to be about 80% heritable when you see these - when you subject it to the same kind of design. Personality traits are about 56%. Political views - 30 to 40%, I would say. VEDANTAM: One of the big implications of all of this work, besides just being interesting in itself, is that it helps us, I think, think about the political conflicts we have with fresh insight. And you've made the case that, in many ways, the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological, in some ways, it changes the way we think about those differences. Talk to me about that idea, John. HIBBING: Yes. When other traits have been understood to be biological - I'm thinking of something like handedness. You know, we used to think that if you were left-handed, that was just because you got into a lazy habit. My father was left-handed, and the teacher - you know, this was long ago - would beat him on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand, trained him to write with his right hand. So we viewed that as a flaw, something that need to be driven out. Of course, now we understand that being left-handed is very biological. This is something much deeper than just a lazy habit. Or of course, you know the big one today would be sexual orientation. When people realized that sexual orientation is indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do, then people are much more tolerant of that. So we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics. If we realize that our political opponents were not simply being lazy but rather were oriented to the world in a different fashion, that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them, that this is the only way we're going to get anywhere if we at least understand where they're coming from, even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions. VEDANTAM: What would you say to critics who would say, you know, the argument that psychological traits and biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because we didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives. There was a time when we had many, many more people in the center. The most liberal Republican was often to the left of the most conservative Democrat. And you know, there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years. What explains this change, especially over the last 20, 30 years? HIBBING: What I would say to that argument is that I believe we have always had this very same division, this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and trying new things. Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote - and I'm sorry I can't give it to you verbatim - but it's basically that the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of innovation is very old and has structured the world since time began. VEDANTAM: John Hibbing is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He has spent years studying the psychological and neurological differences between liberals and conservatives. Along with Kevin Smith and John Alford, he is the co-author of the book, \"Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, And The Biology Of Political Differences.\" John, thanks for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. HIBBING: Thank you, Shankar. It was a pleasure to be with you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Our partisan divide today can make it feel that our nation is at a breaking point. But my next guest says disagreement makes democracy robust. DAVID MOSS: Certainly in the United States, conflict has been - not every time, but a lot of the time - very productive. VEDANTAM: I speak with historian David Moss after the break. I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: There are four words often used to describe America today. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Seems like the country is more divided than ever. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The country and the Congress are more divided than ever. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: At a time when the country is more divided than ever divided than ever... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Americans are more divided than ever. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: I think this country is more divided than ever. I think... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Republicans and Democrats now more divided than ever before. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Most polls say that Americans are more divided than ever. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Are we more divided than ever? VEDANTAM: More divided than ever. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGS) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Not my president, not my president, not my president. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: If you feel our nation is at a breaking point, today's show may provide you some solace. Historian David Moss takes the long view. In his book \"Democracy: A Case Study,\" David argues that intense political conflict to the point where it looks like our democracy is about to fail has been with us since the country was born. In fact, he argues, such conflict, far from being a harbinger of doom, is actually a sign of vitality. MOSS: I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect, but it is extraordinarily resilient. And it has generated tremendous progress. VEDANTAM: Many people judge political success or failure based on whether their side wins. David uses a different metric. He says, in the long term, real success and failure is about the health or sickness of democracy itself. Does conflict strengthen our bonds, or does it destroy the fabric that holds us together? In today's episode, we'll use American history as a lens to look at how conflict can sometimes bring people together and sometimes tear them apart. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I started by asking David the obvious question. At a time when political conflict seems to be pulling the country apart, how can he possibly be optimistic? MOSS: Certainly, in the United States, conflict has been - not every time, but a lot of the time - very productive. And so I could give you many examples, and maybe we could talk about some of them. But really, if you think about, for example, in the economic marketplace, competition - conflict - is really what drives innovation, new ideas. And the same thing happens in the political sphere. So you have - you know, you have two parties. You have different interest groups. You have all sorts of different people trying to fight it out. And in the process, you get all sorts of good ideas that are surfaced. And so conflict/competition in the political marketplace is crucial. VEDANTAM: David says that what matters is not whether there's conflict but whether that conflict is constructive or destructive to democracy. If you just focus on the conflict, you might not see the real picture. To understand the effects of different kinds of conflict, I asked David to tell me about three moments in American history where political disagreements were so intense it seemed like the country might implode. In one case, as we will see, it nearly did. The first moment was just a few years after the founding of the new nation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We think of today as being an unusually bitter moment in politics. But the Founding Fathers were happy to sling mud, too. Thomas Jefferson's supporters called John Adams hideous and hermaphroditical. Adams called Alexander Hamilton that bastard brat of a Scottish peddler. The nasty talk was hardly the worst of it. There were deep disagreements about what it meant to be a country. George Washington said he was mortified that political fighting had left the country looking, quote, \"ridiculous and contemptible.\" MOSS: It did appear to many, including Washington, that the country might be falling apart. So if you look at what was going on, this new nation had just declared their independence in 1776. And so you know, they're jubilant about having won this battle. But it turns out that things sort of turned south fairly quickly. VEDANTAM: At the time, the new nation was not yet governed by our Constitution, but by another document known as the Articles of Confederation. MOSS: And they really made the states almost all-powerful. The states were sovereign. Federal government existed, but it was very weak. There was no president. There was no Supreme Court, just a Congress. And the Congress had very limited power. For example, it could spend, and it could borrow, but it couldn't tax. So the federal government is soon in default. The economy falls into recession. Economists disagree about exactly how severe it was. Some say it was even worse than the Great Depression. Many say it was much less severe. But in any case, people at the time thought it was a pretty bad problem. So there were all these different things going on, and that's why Washington is mortified beyond expression. In fact, he goes on, and he said that he's mortified beyond expression - that at the moment of our acknowledged independence, we look ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of all Europe. And so what he's saying is we founded this country, and it's falling apart. VEDANTAM: So as the states are wrangling with one another and we're trying to figure out whether to actually have a workable federal government, it turns out that the states come up with something of a compromise in terms of how to build the institutions of what today we think of as the modern federal government. MOSS: One of the first debates was - how do you build Congress? The small states wanted a Congress that would represent them one vote per state. So a state like Delaware or New Hampshire would want that. But other states, the large states, wanted proportional representation - representation according to the number of voters. But in any case, as they were trying to figure out how to set up Congress, they came up with an interesting compromise, which we all know is the great compromise, where they set up the House of Representatives, as you well know, is going to be organized by proportional representation, and the Senate is going to be two votes per state. But what's particularly interesting about this is that I think often, people think about compromise. And we think - and you hear this all the time today - we need to compromise; we need to meet in the middle. Meeting in the middle is one form of compromise that occurs sometimes. But I think even more common I think in American history in dealing with the kind of conflict that I see is that you don't meet in the middle. You do sort of the best of both. So what you see is the small states got what they wanted, and the large states got what they wanted. So instead of meeting in the middle or splitting the difference, they did both. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So the historical moment that mortified Washington also resulted in a model of government that has endured for more than two centuries. The conflict was painful but productive. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Nearly 100 years later, the new nation was tested again, this time after the election of Abraham Lincoln. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character, reading) Let the consequences be what they may. Whether the Potomac is crimsoned in human gore, and Pennsylvania Avenue is paved 10 fathoms in depth with mangled bodies or whether the last vestige of liberty is swept from the face of the American continent, the South will never submit to such humiliation and degradation as the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. VEDANTAM: An Atlanta newspaper expressed what many were feeling in the country at the time. Southern states were starting to secede. It was the eve of the Civil War. While the Civil War brought slavery to an end, David still thinks of this moment as an example of destructive conflict. That's because the conflict wasn't resolved through the democratic process, but through the bloodiest war in American history. MOSS: In a sense, the Southerners - those who are going to favor secession - they're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy. And so when Lincoln is elected and he opposes the expansion of slavery - interestingly, he didn't oppose slavery, per se; he wasn't calling for abolition at that point. But he didn't want to see slavery expand, and that was a very controversial issue. And many Southerners who believed that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states, they couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president of the United States would oppose the expansion of slavery. And so although he was elected - and I think they recognized he was elected, in a sense, fair and square - they just couldn't accept him as president. And so what you see is they're putting a policy issue - in this case, an entire worldview and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery - they put that ahead of the democracy. And so now the conflict just descends into rancor and violence. And so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength, but they can also be an incredible source of weakness. And the question is, do we have something in common that's holding us together? In most of American history, the answer's been yes. At that moment in history, the answer was, unfortunately, absolutely not. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if one of the things you are implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict, they're actually willing to say, I believe very strongly that I'm right, but I want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of value, or it may be that history will show in the future, 20 years from now, there is something that I don't know. And I'm wondering if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about, which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that in productive conflict, people say, there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future. MOSS: I think that's correct. I think that's true. But even if they don't think they could be wrong, there's a sense that if you believe in the democracy so much, there's only so far you're willing to go. And so you know, if you think, another analogy would be in a family. Right? So a family, we - you know, every family, people fight; they quarrel; they disagree about all sorts of things. But if there's love in the family, the conflict only goes so far. If the love breaks down, then actually, the conflict can rip the family apart. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In the 20th century, the bonds of that democracy were tested again. When we come back - the political upheavals of the 1960s and their echoes today. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: You're listening to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We are now in the 1960s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9: Mass marches, rallies and demonstrations... (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVE OF DESTRUCTION\") BARRY MCGUIRE: (Singing) The Eastern world... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #10: Protests, picket lines and beatings occur each week all across our land. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH, \"I HAVE A DREAM\") MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: This promissory note insofar... VEDANTAM: Martin Luther King Jr. is leading the civil rights struggle. There are deep partisan divisions in the country. It's another moment of crisis where it seems like the nation is coming apart. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH, \"I HAVE A DREAM\") KING JR: America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. (CHEERING) VEDANTAM: King finds that progress isn't achieved by reaching quickly for consensus. He finds, in fact, that progress comes from triggering conflict. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KING JR: I have a feeling that if we can get a breakthrough in Birmingham and really break down the walls of segregation, it will demonstrate to the whole South - at least, the hardcore South - that it can no longer resist. VEDANTAM: Here's historian David Moss. MOSS: I think what was so brilliant about King - but also before him, if you look at the - a long line. From the early 20th century, the NAACP was trying to think about, how do we make change? And what they thought was - we're going to embrace democracy; we're going to hug democracy tightly. And we're going to reveal the hypocrisy. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH, \"I HAVE A DREAM\") KING JR: We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #11: Yes. KING JR: ...A check that will give us, upon demand, the riches of freedom and the security of justice. (CHEERING) MOSS: And I think what leaders of the civil rights movement figured out is that hypocrisies actually can be a plus, not just a minus. So if you can bring it out - if you can expose it, if you can put it in front of people and show that the principles they hold dear are being violated - that, in some cases at least, forces people to choose. Sometimes they choose wrong, unfortunately. But sometimes they actually side with principle. So this is basically what Martin Luther King was trying to do. He wanted to pick some of the most challenging places to protest - Birmingham, Ala., Selma - knowing that there were some pretty tough people on the other side, some pretty brutal police and sheriffs on the other side who were going to take that opportunity to beat up the protesters, use dogs, water cannons and so on. So what he realized is that if you could make people in their living rooms see this violence and bring it out, you know, to - into the light of day, then suddenly, this hypocrisy, which unfortunately was at the heart of the country at that point - we were talking about equal protection, but we weren't living equal protection. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE SCREAMING) MOSS: Without television, I don't think he could possibly have done it. But with television, he was able to go march peacefully, protest peacefully. The reaction, though, came. And it came swiftly from the other side, and it put on display this hypocrisy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN F KENNEDY: The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can furtively choose to ignore them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSS: So what you see once again is this link between conflict tied to this deep faith in the democracy - even how imperfect - I mean, imperfect is an understatement. (SOUNDBITE OF \"I HAVE A DREAM\" SPEECH) KING JR: The Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and chains... VEDANTAM: When you think about some of the other leaders of the time, there were certainly people who were advocating some version of what the South was saying in 1861. There were people who were saying, look. The system is so broken; it is so faulty that there is no fixing it. We actually have to break it down. And I think the point that you're making is really well-made, which is that King wrapped himself in the flag. He wrapped himself in this ideal of the American democracy. And that potentially is what made the conflict productive. MOSS: Right. So look. There were a lot of things he was concerned about. But he said, let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them. I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect, but it is extraordinarily resilient. And it has generated tremendous progress - economic progress, social progress, political - a lot slower than we'd all like. But boy, things can go very badly, and we all know that. And so the question is - can you continue to make progress? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United States? Are we on the brink of a new chapter in our democracy or on the brink of divorce? I asked David about a number of more recent developments that raise troubling signals about the health of our democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Not my president, not my president. Donald Trump, go away - racist, sexist, anti-gay. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #12: You're still questioning the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate. TRUMP: Very simple, I have people looking into it. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #13: We are introducing articles of impeachment to remove President Trump from office. Given the magnitude of the constitution crisis, there's no reason for the... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #14: This is not based on any real theories of law. This is the congressional equivalent of petulant children throwing a temper tantrum 'cause their team lost. VEDANTAM: Are these modern conflicts business as usual? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Or has something changed? MOSS: I think both. I mean, it depends what you want the comparison to be. I think that, relative to much of the 20th century, we've been more partisan. We're more partisan today than in a long time. But I have to say, if you look back in the 19th century, there were strong divisions - very powerful divisions. At one moment, that, of course, led to the Civil War. But most of the time, those divisions actually did not lead to anything like violence. In fact, they often led to very productive conflicts. So I don't think the question - I don't think the right question is - is there too much conflict? Again, I think conflict, especially if it stays in the political realm, is a very good thing. It generates good ideas. The question is - what do we have in common? I think that's really - we have to ask ourselves not - how do we suppress conflict? - but how do we elevate what we have in common? So we don't have a common ethnic origin. We don't have a common religion. This country is very different from many others. We have people coming from all over. Back in 1776, the Continental Congress, just hours after it adopted the Declaration of Independence, it asked a very powerful, heavyweight group of people - John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin - to develop a seal for the United States of America - the great seal, a two-sided emblem. They wanted some marketing materials for this new country they'd just formed. And anyway, these three come up with a design, and Congress doesn't like it. They reject it. They come up with another design. But Franklin, in that process, came up with three words that Congress did like. And those three words were Latin words e pluribus unum. He took those words not from a great Roman thinker but rather from a magazine he liked called Gentleman's Magazine. It was a literary magazine. And on the cover were these words e pluribus unum - out of many, one. And what they were trying to say in the magazine was out of many fragments of literary works, one magazine. But he saw it as out of many states and peoples, one nation. And I think what he understood really very early was that diversity - difference - created great strengths for the country. But what was going to create that unity, it was going to be our common belief in democratic self-governance. So as we look at conflict, I think it's maybe a fool's errand to try to suppress conflict. The question is, do we have enough in common to hold it together? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Political scientists have noticed that both parties are becoming more ideologically consistent. In other words, Republicans are more conservative, and Democrats are more liberal than they used to be. I asked David if this kind of polarization might be leading to a destructive conflict. MOSS: Look. We don't know, so I want to be careful. I'm a historian. I look backwards; I'm not so good at predicting the future. And I think none of us are. So we don't know if this type of conflict is itself dangerous. I guess I'm not convinced that it is. I think a much bigger concern - and if you look at - for example, Gallup asks this question on a regular basis - if you ask - do you have confidence in your fellow Americans to make decisions as part of our democracy? - actually that number has been falling quite dramatically. And the number who say that they have little or no confidence in their fellow Americans has increased sharply from about 15% in the early 1970s to about 43% today. Those are big numbers. I have to say. I worry much more about those numbers than ideological conformity and so on. I think the question is, do you have some faith in those around you? Even if you disagree with them sharply, do you believe in the system? Are you willing, when you lose, to accept it? And are you going to be treated with some degree of respect when you lose, as well? You know, as we think about winning and losing, we have to lose with grace, and we have to win with grace, as well. And maybe we just have to be careful not to let the winning and losing become a value of its own. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm wondering - as you're thinking about the long sweep of history, it's clear there have been many, many, many examples where things look like they're falling apart, and they haven't. And the case you make as a result is that the country is resilient. But I'm wondering if this belief in our resilience can hide the fact that sometimes actually we might be at risk. In other words, it's only in hindsight that you know that a certain thing turned out well or badly. In the moment, how do you know which way it's going to go? MOSS: Right. So I think you need to look at - is the culture of democracy strong enough to hold us together? That's the question I keep asking. How do you know? You need to look at your politicians. Look at the ones on your side, who agree with you. And do you see them ever putting democracy in second place? And how often do they do it? So I'll leave it to listeners to make that decision. My guess is you can find some examples of that, and you can find examples in history. The more severe that becomes, the more dangerous it becomes. It's good, I think, in a democracy to be hypochondriacs - that is to think that, oh, our system might be sick because when you think it might be sick, you start to take some action. VEDANTAM: One of the other factors you identified that's different about partisanship today from partisanship in the past is that you say partisanship in the past was more exuberant. What do you mean by exuberant partisanship, and how could we bring that back? MOSS: So as you say - I think if you go back into the 19th century, partisanship was extremely, extremely strong. But there was a life in it, an excitement. And that came out, for example, beautifully on Election Day. Election Day was a celebration. It was a party. It was completely different from Election Day today. What do I mean by that? Well, back then, actually voting was public. You would go and cast a ballot. Your ballot usually had a color. It might be pink. It might be blue. And it would reflect what party you were voting for. Everyone could see when you put the ballot in. And there were a lot of people around you. In fact, usually at your voting place, there was a celebration going on. There was a lot of debating. There was a lot of drinking. There was a lot of fighting. There was a lot going on. Overall, the voting rates were up at 70, 75, 80% - so very high voting rates, much higher than we have today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSS: So there was this celebratory atmosphere that was going on every Election Day. And part of that was something we wouldn't want to repeat. So you know, why were ballots so public? Why was voting so public? Well, part of it was political machines wanted to be able to pay people off to vote for their party. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN SQUEAKING) MOSS: And you couldn't really pay people off if you couldn't see how they were going to vote. So if you're going to pay them a dollar to vote this way or that, you had to make sure you knew how they're actually going to vote. So you had to see - you had to have someone at the polling place watch them put the vote in. So there was a downside. There was a corruption associated with this old system. But unfortunately, when we fixed that, we ended up taking the life out of voting. And now most people go; they vote. They vote in a private booth, and they make their decision. They walk out. They maybe buy a brownie at a bake sale or something. And that's about it. But there is a question. Could we have a little bit more of that celebratory atmosphere? Could Election Day be a holiday? Could it be more of a celebration? And what you'd see is a lot more people engaged in the democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSS: So we got a cleaner electoral system. I wouldn't want to give that up. But boy, we lost something in the process. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: David Moss is the author of \"Democracy: A Case Study.\" He's a historian at Harvard University.

Every month, Betsy loads her podcast feed with HIDDEN BRAIN and makes a 14-hour drive to visit her son in a Texas prison. During their visit, Betsy tells him about the stories she's listened to on the way. In an email she wrote, a Texas prison is not a place of rehabilitation but a place where men and women are demeaned, dehumanized, diminished to a number. But for those few hours during the visit, my son is Matt (ph) - son, husband, daddy, brother, friend. Through your podcast, she says, you have joined us on this journey. Your stories have become a part of our story. Thanks, Betsy. Notes like yours are a source of inspiration to all of us at HIDDEN BRAIN. Before we go today, we're looking for your help with a story we're working on. When you were a kid, maybe you felt like Mr. Rogers or Big Bird was speaking just to you. As an adult, maybe it seems that Beyonce is the only person who really understands you. If so, you've been in a parasocial relationship, a one-sided social interaction that can sometimes feel as real as any friendship. We want to talk about these relationships in an upcoming episode.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. In the early 1990s, Jim Heckman traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas. He was there to see something that had been described to him as a miracle. It was a program for students who had dropped out of high school. JAMES HECKMAN: And they said, you know, we have a program which will take high school dropouts, people who had dropped out in ninth grade or before, actually, and converted them into high school graduates within two to three months in our program. And then we send them out to the workplace. So I said, well, this is amazing. VEDANTAM: The program that gave young people a second chance is now known widely across the country. It's called the GED. HECKMAN: Which was a program which students studied for, a test. And at the end of the test, they were certified as legitimate high school graduates. VEDANTAM: Jim is an economist, and he wanted to know whether people with a GED were as successful as people with a high school diploma. He started by looking at their test scores. HECKMAN: What really surprised me was their test scores were virtually the same. VEDANTAM: Within a few months, the GED program was allowing students to catch up with peers who had spent years in high school. But then Jim looked further. Were GED grads holding onto jobs and long-term relationships, staying out of trouble? HECKMAN: If you looked at the GEDs, you realized they weren't doing so well. These were people who had dropped out of school in the first place. They were likely - it turned out - if they got a job, to quit the job or be fired. If they went into marriage or some partnership, how stable were those compared to the ordinary high school graduate? Much less stable. What about their crime? Much more likely to commit crime. VEDANTAM: What was going on? Why were GED recipients struggling if they had the same test scores as high school graduates? HECKMAN: It was kind of a revealing insight that these people were as smart as high school graduates measured by the kind of test that so much public policy focuses on. But in real life, they were really not succeeding in any real way. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, untangling the mystery Jim Heckman discovered in Corpus Christi and the astounding implications his findings have for public policy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: James Heckman is a professor at the University of Chicago. In 2000, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Some of his early work focused on programs like the GED that are designed to give young people a second chance. Jim found that these programs were succeeding in getting young people to do well in tests but failing when it came to improving their outcomes in life. It prompted him to ask broader questions about the American educational system. HECKMAN: I realized that the whole educational establishment, at least the establishment that looked at test scores and that valued schools and valued people by these test scores, really was just missing important dimensions of human behavior. And so that brought me onto a subject which has fascinated me and which I think is really important for success and understanding success and failure, and that is the notion of what I called noncognitive skills. By noncognitive skills, I meant skills that weren't measured by these tests. And what I found and that surprised me was that those noncognitive skills were extremely important. And then when you think about it, you say, well, what an idiot. Of course these are important. You know, and then you go back to everything you ever heard from the time you were a child - the Aesop's fables, the tortoise and the hare and, you know, Teddy Roosevelt saying, you know, it's the man of grit and the person who would go down who gets back up again and tries and, you know, all of the mottoes we quote to our children and that many presidents and leaders have told us for centuries. I mean, it's in many religious teachings. So I said, you know, this is obviously true. But it turned out that in psychology at that time, there was a sense that somehow personality and the subject of personality was kind of, you know, a dark and unrigorous corner, whereas the IQ test, there we actually had machinery to measure it. We had ways to score tests and so forth and so on. So what I did then is that started a lifetime investigation on these social and emotional skills. The GEDs are very deficient in those. Now that we have good measures of those, we see that they're far worse than the high school graduates. And there's evidence, by the way, that staying in school, that working through will build those skills. VEDANTAM: Jim says there is another word for these skills - character. HECKMAN: One time in American education - I mean, I'm talking a long time ago, when Horace Mann was devising the first common schools for all Americans - character training was literally part of the curriculum. I think Horace Mann has a quote in the 1840s when he was setting up this movement. And basically, he said something which says it all, really, you know, that reading, writing and arithmetic is but a small portion of what we teach in school. And then he goes on to say that what we're really teaching is character. We're teaching children how to stay on task, to control their emotions, to work with others, to persist. And so this whole bundle of attributes we know are important in life and the common school was designed basically to foster all of those. VEDANTAM: A clear example of character education was the hugely popular textbook series called McGuffey Readers. You'd find them in many classrooms between the mid-19th century and the mid-20th century. The textbooks were filled with stories about how to live a virtuous life. This one is about a hen who works hard to take care of her 12 chicks. She asks them to follow her as she jumps across a brook to a stone. But they don't obey. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Reading) Oh, mother, we can't, we can't, we can't, said all the little chickens. Yes, you can, if you try, said the old hen. Just flap your wings as I did, and you can jump over. VEDANTAM: Only one of the chickens, Chippy, even tries. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Reading) When they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to eat. She soon found near the back door a piece of bread. So she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one trying to get a bite at the piece of bread. No, no, said the old hen. This bread is for Chippy. He is the only one of my children that really tried to jump to the stone. HECKMAN: One of the most interesting is a story about a couple of boys who ran away from school, played hooky, stole a boat. And then the ocean came up, and they were nearly drowned. And finally, by the grace of God, they were thrown onto the beach and saved. And they learned their lesson, and they never ran away from school again. And they did their lessons. So there were a lot of stories like that. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of some elements of society - and I really mean it was unfortunate - those early lessons were more or less using the Bible, the Protestant Bible, as the touchstone to teach morality and character. And then, of course, other groups, as they came to the United States - more Catholics, for example, Jews and other groups - as they came, they found this very offensive. They didn't want to get their children indoctrinated. And so that aspect of character gradually got edited out of the common school. And then psychology meanwhile had this, quote, \"development,\" this great breakthrough that was really cognitive psychology that really said IQ and, you know, cognition and pure problem-solving ability, that was really the be-all and end-all of an education and that we shouldn't worry about this touchy-feely stuff - you know, building Americans, learning to work with others, understanding democracy. All of that was viewed as junk. And it really hit the trash can in the late '50s when Sputnik surprised Americans. And literally, if you read the education journals of the time, what really was needed was, you know, get your math right. Get your science right. And the rest of it was kind of taken for granted. VEDANTAM: So this is fascinating because what you're pointing out is that for a long time, the link between character and what was taught in school had a religious component to it. And as the country became perhaps more secular or more diverse, people had some resistance to bringing those religious ideas along. But of course, you don't need religion to teach questions related to character. Modern psychology has done a lot of thinking about some of these traits. What traits are we talking about when we use the term character? What kind of traits are these? HECKMAN: Well, there's a range of traits. What I mean is the ability to plan. How well can I actually plan my life forward, make good use of time? How well can I persist on a task, and how resilient am I? If I experience failure, how far can I go and bounce back and try, try again? How open am I to experience? So in other words, am I closed off? Do I sort of shun contact with new ideas and with new people? How agreeable am I in the sense of, you know, I may find somebody disagrees with me, but that doesn't mean I have to fight them? There's a sense of having a sense of propriety about the relationship. So this term character is a quite broad term, really, very elastic in some ways. VEDANTAM: One of the most important qualities that Jim identified is conscientiousness, or what the psychologist Angela Duckworth calls grit. Jim also found that the ability to delay gratification matters a lot. HECKMAN: In other words, I can see a gain. If I wait today, like, go to school - it's unpleasant; I don't like the teacher; I don't like studying. But I know that if I finish these two years, I will have much better opportunity in life. So I control myself and stay in school. You know, I grin and bear it, I guess is the way to describe it. So I think it's this ability to manage yourself and to work with others. It's both. VEDANTAM: Do you think this is true for even Nobel Prize winners? I mean, when you look at your own life and career, do you see sort of the role of character, of perseverance and conscientiousness and grit, as in some ways being just as important or perhaps more important than cognitive and intellectual abilities? HECKMAN: Oh, for sure. And the reason why I say for sure is take some truly important scientist like Marie Curie. You know, her work, for example, in isolating radium, taking pitchblende or distilling it in the back of some sheds in Paris back more than 100 years ago, that was just brutal grunt work. She had an idea, for sure, but it required that she stay with it and stay with it for years. Take all of the rocket scientists - many failures to, say, get a satellite into orbit or to get a rocket to fly. I think in every case, especially in science but especially in learning, literally, you have to stay with it. And it's one of the loneliest things in the world, original research. Bertrand Russell, in his autobiography, has a great line. He was a very young man, a brilliant guy, a acknowledged genius. And he described how every morning he would go to his desk, and there was a sheet of paper. And he was trying to prove something. It turned out what he was really trying to prove was impossible, so the story is even better in that regard. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HECKMAN: But he went there. And he said he would look at this paper all day. And then he would go home or go back to his bed and sleep without having written a line on it. And he did this for weeks, sometimes months, because he was waiting for a breakthrough. His mind was working, but he couldn't write anything down. So it really is a question of staying with it. And that's why, you know, Einstein said it. Edison said it. You know, genius is, like, 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. I mean, there are some people who strike it rich. I mean, you fall down. And you see, oh, my God. I stubbed my toe on a piece of gold, and it goes down one mile. And you're rich or something. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HECKMAN: But that's pretty unusual. Pretty unusual. VEDANTAM: You know, we had Angela Duckworth on HIDDEN BRAIN maybe a year or two ago. And she told me something really interesting during that conversation. She brought up something the German philosopher Nietzsche had said about how we all, in some ways, want to believe that genius and talent essentially spring out of nowhere, spring out of the soil. And he apparently said, the performer has an incentive to want to suggest that, you know, his or her genius was natural, that it just was - it required no effort because it makes the performer look good. But he had an important insight about the audience, that the audience also in some ways wants to believe that grit and hard work and perseverance were not necessary because what the audience wants to say is that the person who is playing this piano so beautifully before me, this person just has a gift. And I can't play the piano that well because I just don't have the same gift. And so seeing things as natural in some ways relieves us of the obligation or the hope or the possibility that we might be able to match that performance. And so there's almost a conspiracy in society to believe that good outcomes come naturally as opposed through - you know, through conscientiousness, persistence and hard work. HECKMAN: I'll add to that story, a true story. In Los Alamos during the Second World War, when these brilliant physicists were all trying to develop the atom bomb and develop atomic energy and make it usable for military purposes - many brilliant people, and they were in these laboratories working. But apparently - and I know this - I had a high school teacher who was part of that group for a while. And he told me that everybody, in the course of the day, they would sit around and play volleyball. And they would appear to be just naturally just very bright. And papers would show up, and calculations would get done. And then he said, if you went there at night, you'd realize in every office people were staying up all night doing the work. But they didn't want to admit how hard they were working to anybody else. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). Even if some people want to project the image that their achievements come naturally, Jim says it's clear that conscientiousness and other character skills play a huge role in success. That's true whether we're talking about a scientist in Los Alamos or a recent high school graduate. When we come back, how to develop these skills in the neediest kids and the extraordinary effect this can have on their lives. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In 1963, Louise Derman-Sparks got her first job as a teacher at the Perry Preschool Project. It served disadvantaged African American kids in Ypsilanti, Mich. LOUISE DERMAN-SPARKS: I was - what? - 23, (laughter) 24. It's hard to imagine now. I'm 79 now, so it was a while ago. VEDANTAM: Her lessons with the preschoolers appeared simple, but they usually had a hidden curriculum. Louise encouraged the kids to develop what we'd now call noncognitive skills. She gives an example of something called dramatic play. The kids would dress up and perform. DERMAN-SPARKS: I would take a role and help the kids expand their play, not by telling them what to do, letting the kids create the script. But I would make certain demands where they would have to respond. If I was the storekeeper, they would bring me something. And I might say, well, did you see how much this cost? And then I'd think, well, who's in your family, and what kinds of foods might they need to eat? VEDANTAM: By adding up the cost of items in the pretend store, the kids learned arithmetic. But they also learned other things. DERMAN-SPARKS: Planning skills, expanding their awareness of the world. We felt that communication and developing and expanding language was really important for the kids because it's important in society, and it's very important in order to be successful in school. VEDANTAM: She often moved learning experiences outside of the classroom. DERMAN-SPARKS: Frankly, we used to just put them in our cars. VEDANTAM: The teachers took the students around the community to a bakery, an orchard, the airport. DERMAN-SPARKS: That was always a favorite trip. They were fascinated, of course, by the - you know, watching the planes take off and come down. And those were days where you could actually go in - right into the takeoff areas, departure areas. We wanted to expand their world experience because the families were very poor, and most of them didn't even have their own cars. So the kids were really restricted to a pretty small physical area. What we wanted to do was for them to be able to have the concrete experiences in the world that children from middle-class homes had and to learn to be comfortable in these larger arenas of the world - of their world. VEDANTAM: Jim Heckman says the program was a creation of a group of educators connected with the University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University. HECKMAN: They were trying to think of how they could improve the lives of those children starting from a very early age. So they operated on the belief that early investments, early environments, played a tremendous role. And the initial program was designed to boost the IQ of disadvantaged children. VEDANTAM: One thing that made the program unusual was that families were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first got the intervention. The second was a control group. When the results started rolling in after a few years, they were initially disappointing. By the time children were 10, there wasn't much of a difference in how children in the two groups performed on tests of cognitive ability. HECKMAN: And it led a lot of people at the time to conclude that the program was a failure, and it was a failure because it had not boosted IQ. And that program was launched in the 1960s at a time when IQ was considered the be-all and end-all of life success. VEDANTAM: Partly because the study was conducted so long ago, researchers have been able to follow the kids who went through the Perry Preschool Program for a very, very long period of time. What have you and others found when you look at the kids who went through the Perry Preschool Program in terms of their life outcomes? HECKMAN: Well, that's the interesting part. They were much more likely to kind of be cooperative, much more likely to engage in school - and then going forward, much more likely to graduate high school, much more likely to make earnings, much more likely to go on to college, much less likely to commit crime. And so when you started following people into the 20s and into the 30s, you saw substantial benefits that came from this program. And that, by the way, has an important lesson. I mean, the lesson is that if you start doing interventions and then evaluate them within a few years and not recognize that these programs have multiple effects, and you don't allow those effects to kind of generate and express themselves, we can reach very premature negative conclusions. VEDANTAM: In some ways, this sounds like you're going back to the soft-skill story we talked about in our - the first part of our conversation, that those were the factors that were driving these outcomes. HECKMAN: Exactly. See, in some sense it was a total confirmation of what we'd also seen in the GED work, that it's these social and emotional skills that, A, are malleable - much more malleable than we used to think; B, can be measured; and, C, are very powerful in producing life outcomes. So in that sense, I think, the two lines of research come together beautifully. VEDANTAM: One of the things that has excited a lot of people about the Perry Preschool program and programs like it is what you mentioned a second ago, that the skills that are important in driving life outcomes are not just - you know, it's not just enough to say that they're character skills or they involve these different traits but that these traits actually might be malleable, that actually we can do something to change them - that in some way instead of thinking of them just as traits, it might actually be useful to think of them as skills, skills that can be taught, skills that can be learned. And that's a remarkably hopeful message in terms of thinking about ways we can improve the life outcomes of lots of people. HECKMAN: I agree. In fact, even in this conversation, we were talking about traits. I increasingly use the word skills because skills can be changed. That would be true both for IQ and for personality traits. We understand much more now. IQ gets to be fairly stable by around age 10. If you start early enough, like at birth, you can actually boost IQ even. But IQ tends to be fixed at least in terms of your rank and the IQ distribution by somewhere, 10 to 12 - you know, varies among people. But then it becomes much harder to change it. However, personality traits are actually emerging. And so if you look at the work on neuroscience, you look at the work on behavioral science, many, many excellent behavioral people, they're showing that many more what we can think of as personality and character traits emerge as people get older. VEDANTAM: What exactly did the Perry Preschool program do to boost these character traits, these character skills? HECKMAN: Well, it's interesting. If you study it, two things that I think were really important - the program lasted two years during the regular school year. These kids are 3 and 4. And they came in for 2 1/2 hours a day. The curriculum was very easy to describe. They basically - they planned tasks, they executed tasks, and then they reviewed the tasks collectively. So it had many aspects where kids were picking a project, staying with it and finishing a project. Project could be building a small wooden boat or maybe painting a picture and then evaluating each other's work - working together. So it had this social interaction on top of the activities. And so the kid each week, each day for five days a week for about 39 weeks a year, two years in a row, they would start doing these projects. They would stay on those tasks, and they would review the tasks. And then they would go back home and maybe even bring the art back home. So that was part of it. But another component sometimes gets lost. It wasn't just that the program operated with the kids. It also visited the parents. It tried to build the parents' engagement, the parent with the child. And that was really important because a lot of parents then and even now don't understand how important they are in stimulating, motivating, cultivating the child and getting the child to stay on task and, you know, learn. And so the parents themselves got galvanized and worked with the child. So the child and a visitor - a person from the child care center would go home and work with a parent. So you had two things going on - the child's stimulation, the stimulated children came home and they activated parental curiosity - that's one thing; and second, parents themselves were directly encouraged to work with the child. And there was this very, very active engagement on the part of the parents that was - hadn't been there before. And so you can literally see that the parents provide a warmer environment. They spend a lot more time with the child reading, playing and encouraging. And - you can think about it now - yes, the program's over in two years, but the kid doesn't grow up till 17, 18. So you have basically a cocoon, a nourishing cocoon surrounding the child, encouraging the child, staying with the child and fostering that child. VEDANTAM: Sometimes the teachers explicitly taught parents how to use educational materials. In other cases, the meetings were more informal. They focused on building a partnership with the parents. Louise Derman-Sparks described how a home visit played out with one family. DERMAN-SPARKS: I had one child who was the son of a mother who was still in high school. And they were living with the grandparent who worked all day, so I agreed to come in the evening. And the first night, I knock on the door and the mother of the child opens the door. And it was kind of what we used to call a railroad apartment. You know, you had the rooms one behind each other, small little rooms and the kitchen was the third room. And I could see the grandmother standing over the stove in the kitchen. And I knew that she had spent her day standing over a steam iron all day long. And now she was having to stand over the stove. And so the daughter opens the door. And the mother or the grandmother says, who is it? And she says, oh, it's the teacher. And she says, oh, [expletive], is she here? (Laughter) So I realized at that moment that I was intruding into a family's life, that this woman, you know, had been on her feet the whole day. So I just decided then and there that I was going to adopt this much more informal way of doing it. And I asked her if I could sit in the kitchen so that she could keep cooking and bring the child into the kitchen, and we could play some games. And occasionally I would just start chatting with the grandmother. And that built into a relationship where we really could talk with the grandmother, the mother every time I came. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: How can a teacher who chats with a student's grandmother or acts out a scene with preschoolers make a lasting impact on children's lives? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Jim Heckman has followed the kids who went through the Perry Preschool Project. They're now middle-aged. And he's followed what happened to their children. What he finds is that an early investment in disadvantaged kids and their parents can pay dividends across generations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: A half century ago, the children in the Perry Preschool Project dressed up as pretend shopkeepers and learned how to count. They did science experiments without realizing they were doing science experiments. They went to the airport and watched as planes lifted off. They played with their teachers in their own homes as their parents watched. Those children are now middle-aged adults. James Heckman has tracked them to understand how they've done in life and how their children have fared. HECKMAN: We have a very rich - so we went back and interviewed the original participants. And what we did is we gave people not only active tests about IQ, intelligence, things like that, but also we have measures of personality. And then we found out about their lifetime earnings. We looked at criminal justice system records to find out whether they had been incarcerated, what their criminal histories were. So we had measures of their blood pressure. We had measures of their stress. And we had measures of physical health and whether or not they had good diet, hip-waist ratio, various kinds of dimensions. So we were able to measure, and what we find is very encouraging. The original participants are doing much better than the non-treated group. So the treated group - the ones who stayed in the program, who got the treatment - at 55 are doing much better in all these dimensions, including health. You see; that's the part. Think about it for a second. Originally the program was designed to raise IQ. Well, it still doesn't really raise IQ, but it does produce a lot of benefits in self-management, including the ability to manage your own health, to follow a healthy diet, to follow doctor's orders, to actually then go and get educated about disease and disease prevention. So these people are healthier. They also have multiple benefits - less crime, more earnings. And so they're in a better position as they're now looking towards retirement. VEDANTAM: But what do you find when you look at their children? HECKMAN: We look at the children. We find some very strong effects. The children of the participants are healthier. The children of the participants are also earning more. They have better social and emotional skills, are more likely to graduate high school and go on to college, less likely to engage in the criminal justice system, so they're less likely to be incarcerated or even have ever been arrested. So what you see is beneficial effects that go on to the next generation. And you ask, well, how could that be? And I'll tell you how it could be - because the original group, it turns out, not only did they benefit. They're more likely to have stable families and earnings during the time of stability. So they provide their own children with a nurturing environment far richer than it is for the non-treated children. They're more likely to be in stable marriages, more likely to have earnings. And as I mentioned earlier, they're less likely to go to prison, which is a major minus for earnings. So what happens is - more two-parent families, more earnings. Their children have environments which are much richer. And so following a lot of research, the children benefit from being raised in those richer environments. VEDANTAM: There is something quite incredible about a program that, you know, ran in the 1960s for a few years and is intervening in the lives of kids for maybe one or two years. And you're seeing the effects of that program 50 years down the road both in the lives of the people who went through the program and their children. I mean, that is incredible. HECKMAN: Well, remember; I said something. Yes, the program itself lasted two years, but we did change the parents. So we changed - the parents themselves came out of that program with a greater appreciation for what their own children could do and a greater understanding of their importance in nourishing the child. So those original kids grew up in more welcoming, supportive environments than the other children. That - so it wasn't just that we had two years and then dropped them in the ocean somewhere. They really had parents that were supportive. But yes, it is remarkable. It is remarkable because what it leads to then is the hope that this is a social program that not only benefits the recipient; it goes on. And it's, you know, the gift that keeps on giving, if you will. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HECKMAN: We also looked at another program, a later program, more intensive program called the ABC program - that was launched about 10 years later. That started at birth. So that started when the kids were 8 weeks old and had followed the kids until they were age 5 essentially - much richer, eight hours a day, five days a week. And if you look at what happened in that program - we just computed recently the rate of return, which is, you know, the kind of rate that a dollar would earn put in a bank or a bond. So we found that the rate of return on the ABC program - we found that it was 14 percent per annum. And why? We're finding that there was a permanent increase in IQ that didn't fade away 'cause remember; this started at birth. And so starting early on, we can boost IQ. But all the other social dimensions were there. Parenting skills were improved. And then there was another dimension which frequently gets lost in the current discussion. This program also gave child care. And so as a result of the child care, the mothers of these children were able to work. They were able to go back to school, and they themselves had their lives transformed. So the parents were transformed. The children of the parents were transformed. And again you had these intergenerational benefits. If you want to encourage children and raise them to be successful in the sense of controlling their own destiny or at least having more control over their own destiny and feeling - exercising, being the best they can be, we have to enrich family life one way or the other. And these programs do that. VEDANTAM: I'm wondering if you can in some ways make the economic case for spending money. So a lot of people, as you point out, make sort of an argument of fiscal conservatism and say this is a waste of money; it's a black hole; you're going to throw money down the tube; you're not going to see it. As someone who has studied this work for a while, what is the economic case to be made for investing in early interventions especially for families of disadvantage? HECKMAN: Well, the economic case is summarized simply. I mean, very few public investments have a rate of return above 14 percent. And that's what always stuns me when some people say, oh, this is costly. It is costly. You know, the transcontinental railroad was costly. I mean, building airfields and building airports and highways - all of these are costly, but it's the rate of return. It's what do you get out of the cost. And so it's the ROI, in other words. And we know that it's a very high ROI. Unfortunately - and this is where our political system really fails us - that a lot of cases, the return is harvested downstream well after the governor or the mayor, whoever is initiating the program is out of office. And a lot of these benefits are lifetime benefits. And so - but we think about this. We built the Hoover Dam originally in the 1930s and the Grand Coulee Dam. And we built all of these public infrastructure projects. They - really nobody said, oh, Hoover Dam had to pay for itself in six years. But I would argue that long-term investment and looking at what's good for the country for the next generation, even for this generation of adults when they get older and are asking their children to support them - they're going to have a bigger base, a better country with fewer problems, less crime, more health and more earnings and greater civic participation. So I think that's a - it's a social argument, but it's also a really sound economic argument. This is 14 percent per annum. That's beyond anything that most programs offer. VEDANTAM: When you think about some other programs that have been conducted more recently - I'm thinking about a pre-K program in Tennessee, for example, that was evaluated - researchers find that these programs don't have, you know, strong effects on cognitive outcomes but also don't have strong effects on some of the social and emotional skills that we've been discussing. And they argued that in some ways, unlike the small, intensive programs like the Perry program or the ABC program, the Tennessee program was actually what - you know, if you scale up - if you were to scale up programs with early child intervention, what you see in Tennessee is what you would actually get. And that actually argues against spending that kind of money. What would you make of that kind of argument, which is that when you look at these narrow programs and you talk about scaling up, it misses the point that when you scale up, you're going to get something that probably isn't high quality? HECKMAN: Well, I mean, you get what you pay for. I have no doubt about it. This Tennessee program was cheaper. They're the ones who announced that this is the way a program has to look. I don't accept that. I mean, I think there can be higher quality programs that we can and should afford. You know, one of the things we ask - we brought the original Perry people to Chicago, to our center. These are the teachers, the first teachers - back to the '60s. They're quite old now, but they're - many of them are still alive and active and very engaged. So we ask them a basic question - what was the curriculum you used? What is it you did? And so they said, oh, we did for these children what we would do for our own. So think about it for a second. These are middle-class mothers. They basically did for these kids what a middle-class mother does. So now you're asking a slightly different question. We say, OK, that's the ingredient. We're not talking about, you know, having supermen or superwomen come into the program. We're doing the kind of encouragement, warmth, engagement that a successful middle-class family would do for its own children. Now, you ask the question - how expensive is that? Well, that's very expensive. Think about it. I mean, what does it cost for a woman, say, who stays at home - let's take the stay-at-home mother - or even the woman who's working and has very expensive childcare - to actually work and develop the child? You'll see a lot of middle-class women are doing that - going to work but they're also rearing their children. VEDANTAM: And fathers, too. HECKMAN: Yeah, and fathers - primarily mothers, though. I mean, I agree. Fathers are doing it, but that's a trend that's increasing. But it's still at a pretty low level, so yes. But what - I would argue, look; the real problem is the family life. And how do we reproduce the kind of family life we know to be productive? We know it's not cheap. So take an educated college woman who's working say, let's say 35 hours a week - 40. Forty is easier to multiply. And let's suppose she's making something like - I don't know - $30 an hour. So you multiply. So it's like $30 an hour times 40. OK? So you're talking $50,000, $60,000. And probably, a lot of these mothers are worth much more - $50 an hour. They're making that investment. And that's the kind of cost of quality. So when somebody says - oh, you know, we hired a bunch of people at low wages in Tennessee and they didn't produce miracles, they kind of take you to the cleaners with their mindset that's very limited. You know, they're making a whole set of premises that that's the way a program has to be constructed and the rest is just not feasible. I think it is feasible. And we know it's feasible because millions of kids today are getting that precisely in their own homes. They're affluent children, and they're middle-class children. So we know that it's possible. The question is - is it possible to do that for the kids who are severely disadvantaged? And I think it is. But it's going to cost money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: James Heckman is a professor at the University of Chicago. In 2000, he won the Nobel Prize in economics. He is co-editor and co-author of the book \"The Myth Of Achievement Tests: The GED And The Role Of Character In American Life.\" Jim, thank you for joining me today on HIDDEN BRAIN. HECKMAN: Thank you. And I enjoyed the conversation very much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This week's episode was produced by Rhaina Cohen. It was edited by Tara Boyle. Our team includes Jenny Schmidt, Parth Shah, Thomas Lu, Laura Kwerel and Angus Chen. Special thanks to Brooke Valliere. Our unsung hero is David Weikart. He was a psychologist and innovator and the creator of the Perry Preschool Project that we discussed at length in this episode. David, who died in 2003, had the vision not just to launch a randomized control trial among preschoolers but to systematically collect the kind of data that allows us, 50 years down the road, to learn all kinds of important things. There are lots of theories about what makes for a good education. We have David and his fellow education researchers to thank for adding heft and rigor to that conversation.

Renee Klahr hide caption Psychologist Phil Tetlock thinks the parable of the fox and the hedgehog represents two different cognitive styles. \"The hedgehogs are more the big idea people, more decisive,\" while the foxes are more accepting of nuance, more open to using different approaches with different problems. The Greek poet Archilochus wrote, \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" There are many different interpretations of this parable, but psychologist Phil Tetlock sees it as a way of understanding two cognitive styles: Foxes have different strategies for different problems. They are comfortable with nuance; they can live with contradictions. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, focus on the big picture. They reduce every problem to one organizing principle. \"The hedgehogs are more the big idea people, more decisive. In most MBA programs, they'd probably be viewed as better leadership material,\" Tetlock says. This week, we have the story of a hedgehog named Don Laub, a young surgeon who was eager to make his mark. In his words, Don wanted to \"do a big thing, and help a lot of people.\" \"It was a mistake,\" says Don Laub, on his decision to operate on a young boy named Salvador. \"But...I'm not whipping myself.\" Laub is pictured here in 2011. Creative Commons hide caption One day, he got his chance when a colleague asked him if he could help with a surgery. The patient was a child from Mexico with a cleft lip and palate, and the surgery was simple. Don says it gave the child, who had been ostracized in his community, a real chance in life. The experience inspired him to organize trips for surgeons to travel to Mexico and help other children with similar injuries. \"Everybody jumped on it,\" he said. \"I had to hide when I would go into the hospital because people wanted to get in on this.\" His story is one of many triumphs \u2014 and a tragedy that he continues to dwell on many decades later. This week on Hidden Brain, we explore his story, and what it can tell us about how we view our roles in the world.

        "texts": "SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Many of us share our homes with animals - furry, feathered or scaly. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi Charles (ph). Oh, I haven't seen you in a while... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Was it a bad day? Yeah? You awake... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: They are definitely like my family members at this point. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. That's my righthand man. I got no kids, so that's my son, you know? He's my baby. VEDANTAM: Yet, as much as we love our pets, our behavior toward animals can be paradoxical. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Don't you think it's kind of weird that we're eating our cat's meat? And we, you know, have strong beliefs in not eating meat at this point... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I think the more you love animals, the more you might consider being a vegetarian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: The English Bulldog was made by science. You know what I'm saying? Like, I think lizards and reptiles belong with Mother Nature. I don't think English bulldog is a part of Mother Nature. So I'm a walking hypocrite, and I recognize that. And I'm OK with that. VEDANTAM: This week on HIDDEN BRAIN, we explore the contradictions and quandaries of our relationships with animals. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When Hal Herzog's son, Adam, was young, he had a pet mouse named Willie. One day, Willie died, so Hal used this as a teaching moment. HAL HERZOG: We thought it would be a good lesson for the kids, in terms of understanding death, to have a funeral for him. After all, you know, he was a pet. The kids really liked him. And they were very upset when he died. And so we had a funeral. We got a little cardboard box and made a little casket. We took him into the backyard. We buried him. And we actually had a little headstone for him. We got some rocks and made a little headstone for him. VEDANTAM: A couple of days later, Hal's wife found some mouse droppings in the kitchen and asked him to do something about it. HERZOG: Well, my wife's a neatnik. And the idea that we would be sharing our house with, you know, with little creatures scampering around that were mice was not something that she could live with. So she asked me to kill the mouse, and I did. I went out and I bought a mousetrap. I put a little dab of peanut butter on it and put it under the kitchen. And the next morning, I got up and the mouse was dead. VEDANTAM: And, of course, you did what you always do with dead mice, which is you put it in a cardboard box and took it out of the back and gave it a funeral, right? HERZOG: No. I threw it in the bushes. VEDANTAM: Two dead mice, two very different responses. HERZOG: They were in different psychological categories. One was a pet, which a lot of people - including us - sort of considered Willie a family member. He had a name. And the other was a pest. He was freeloading by, you know, stealing our cheese and... VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: ...You know generally being what mice do, that is to say, a pest. So, you know, there is a completely different psychological, you know, relationship between Willie our pet and the pest. VEDANTAM: Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's been studying human-animal interactions for more than 30 years. He writes about the contradictions in our attitudes toward mice and other creatures in his book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals.\" I asked him how the labels we place on animals - good mouse, bad mouse, pet or pest - change how we interact with them. HERZOG: Certainly one of the deepest and most important reasons that we treat animals differently is related to the categories that we put them. That's absolutely true. VEDANTAM: So here's a second story that also lays out a slightly related but different contradiction. Your family once also owned a pet snake. And a nasty rumor spread about what you were feeding the snake. What was the rumor? And what does that reveal, in some ways, about the relationship we have with animals? HERZOG: I got a call one day from a friend of mine who's an animal rights activist. And she said that she had gotten a call from one of her friends saying that I was going to our local animal shelter and getting kittens and taking them home and feeding them to our boa constrictor, who was like Willie, a pet and had a name, Sam. VEDANTAM: What does this to reveal about some of the contradictions we have about animals? You talk a little bit in the book about, you know, both sort of the abhorrence with which we receive this idea that anyone would dream of feeding kittens to snakes. But, of course, in your mind, this also produced something of a thought experiment and some questions about cats and snakes. HERZOG: It did. And actually, for the next couple of days, there was something that kept nagging me about that. And I was thinking, like, OK. You know, what Sam ate - he was a carnivore, like cats. And what he ate was mice. And so I would go, basically, to the pet shop and buy mice to feed to the snake - live mice. And I would, you know, kill the mice and give them to the snake. And I thought, well, wait a minute. There's cats being euthanized at the animal shelter that are unwanted. Wouldn't it be more ethical for me to actually go to the animal shelter and get the bodies of dead kittens as opposed to using - buying live mice? Wouldn't that be morally permissible? Wouldn't it be morally better to actually feed kittens to boa constrictors than to feed mice to boa constrictors? VEDANTAM: And of course, then, that means you went out to the animal shelter and did what the rumor was saying that you were doing. HERZOG: Of course I did not. We were - we had a pet cat at the time. We still have a pet cat. We live with cats. I love cats. I would never feed a cat to a boa constrictor. So this was a classic example of head versus heart. And I realized that moral consistency oftentimes leads us astray in our interactions with animals. And that really haunted me ever since. Like, how could I live in a world in which it was OK to feed kittens to boa constrictors? And interesting, Shankar, the original title of my book was \"Feeding Kittens To Boa Constrictors.\" But the editor and my agent immediately made me change it... VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: ...Because they said nobody would buy a book with that title. VEDANTAM: It sounds like the start of a bad Coen brothers movie. HERZOG: It does. And it snagged me a literary agent. But (laughter) they wouldn't - they wouldn't take the next step. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Tell me about another story that you describe in the book. This guy, Jim Thompson, he's a doctoral student you met. And he owned this very beautiful bird. And he started thinking about that bird. And then he did something unusual with this bird. Walk me through what he did. HERZOG: Yeah. He was a graduate student. And he was a very logical, rational, rational person. And he had a pet bird - it was a cockatiel, as I recall - that he really loved. And his mother had given him a copy of an animal rights magazine - I think it was Animals\u2019 Agenda at the time. And he read the magazine. It changed his life. So he became an animal rights activist, hardcore - became a vegan, quit wearing leather, made his girlfriend start doing all that stuff as well. And then one day, he looked at the bird, who lived in a cage. And he came to the conclusion - the intellectual conclusion that it was unethical to live with a bird in a cage. And so he took the bird outside and he freed it. And the bird flew out of the cage. And he said it was an amazing sight to see that bird take off. And then he told me - he looked at me, he said sheepishly, you know, I know she probably died. I know that I was doing it more for me than I was for the bird. VEDANTAM: You know, it made me think about all the ways in which we sort of relate to animals in some ways as if they were sort of fellow creatures. In other words, if you kept a fellow human being in a cage, it would seem absolutely unjust, immoral and wrong. And releasing that person from the cage would seem like the only right thing to do. And in some ways, we extend that logic when we talk about the bird. That's what he was doing. And as I was reading the story, it reminded me of another story you have in the book. This was a different story but, in some ways, it has the same subtext. Cookie was a 12-foot-long Nile crocodile at the Miami Serpentarium. A 6-year-old boy once fell into Cookie's enclosure. And the croc did what crocodiles do - he grabbed the child, pulled him underwater. What did the owner of the Serpentarium do next? HERZOG: Well, the owner of the - immediately, the owner of the Serpentarium jumped into - he heard the people watching, you know, gasp in horror. And he knew something was going on. He jumped into the cage and tried to save the kid - little David - and failed. And that night, Haast woke up in the middle of the night - I'm assuming he didn't get much sleep. He had a revolver - a Luger - in his bedroom. He put the shells in it. And he went into Cookie's cage and he put nine bullets in his brain. And by the way, he had had Cookie for many, many years. And Cookie was a favorite of his. It was an animal that he loved in a way that probably only herpetologists - somebody like me, you know, who studies reptiles and likes them, you know, can understand. I argue that, in some ways, it's the operation of a phenomenon that cognitive psychologists called heuristics. A heuristic is sort of a mental shortcut and it sometimes leads to good, you know, logical, correct answers, but sometimes it doesn't. And in this case, it seems to be the operation of a type of heuristic called the moral heuristic. And the moral heuristic is revenge. And at one point, The New York Times actually wrote an editorial about that event. And the editorial writer, I think, got it right. And the editorial writer wrote, killing Cookie made no sense intellectually, but it felt right emotionally. VEDANTAM: And the reason it didn't make sense intellectually, of course, is the idea that a crocodile would do what a crocodile does is hardly surprising. HERZOG: That's what crocodiles do. His brain is smaller than a walnut. He is a creature, largely, of instinct, particularly when it comes to food. And he was, you know, doing what crocodiles do. He was not a moral agent, you know, which I would argue is one of the biggest differences between humans and other species. We are moral agents. VEDANTAM: So the interesting thing is that Haast, the owner, in some ways related to Cookie as if Cookie was a person, that Cookie was a moral agent. And in some ways, that's a variation of what Jim Thompson was doing with the bird - wasn't it? - which is, you're assuming that the animal has agency and behaves or thinks or has human-like qualities and that you are therefore obliged or required to treat this other creature as if, in some ways, it had human-like qualities. HERZOG: I'm sure that if you interviewed Haast, he, you know, clearly would know the difference, at an intellectual level, between a crocodile and a person. But you're quite right. He's basically treated them the same way that we would a person. This similarly played out in a bizarre incident that happened in Tennessee, where an elephant named Mary killed its groom while in a circus parade in 1916. And they hung the elephant to death. And, you know, to me that was, you know, the ultimate example of where we've anthropomorphized animals - that we give it capital punishment in a sense for something that it was clearly not morally culpable. VEDANTAM: So people listening to these stories would say, wow, those are really, you know, crazy stories, but as you point out in the book, this tendency we have to anthropomorphize animals is actually really ubiquitous. You draw a contrast between the way we relate to the giant panda and the giant salamander. Tell me what the giant salamander is, what it looks like, and how our attitudes toward these different animals are shaped by the ways in some ways that we anthropomorphize them. HERZOG: Yeah, the - so the animals, in some way, are similar, the giant panda and the giant Chinese salamander, in that they're both endangered and they both live in China and they're both really special, although in quite different ways. The giant Chinese salamander is basically a 6-foot-long bag of brown slime with beady eyes. (Laughter) And, you know, to me, they're like - they're striking. I wouldn't say that they're beautiful, but they're stunning just in their size and they're - I don't know. (Laughter) To me, they're charismatic, but I don't think most people would agree with that. But you're not going to see the World Wildlife Fund putting a picture of the giant Chinese salamander on their logo. Instead, they use the panda. And the panda, you know, in some ways, looks a little bit like a human. But it's basically a faker in the sense that it has these giant circles around its eyes, which ethologists call baby releasers. So we look at that panda and it basically logs on to that - jams into that maternal instinct that we have when we see creatures with big eyes and it impose on them that in some ways it reminds us of a human infant. So, for example, researchers have shown that one of the biggest predictors of whether or not people will give money to save animals is the size of the animal's eyes. And pandas certainly have it when it comes to eye size. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back, do our pets actually improve our lives? HERZOG: Pet owners were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. When we think about pets in the United States, we often picture cats, dogs, maybe a hamster. Hal Herzog says our relationship with animals, especially those we consider pets, is largely dictated by our communities and culture. So, for example, I've got a friend that's an anthropologist who was born and raised in Kenya. And in the village where he was raised, they kept dogs. The dogs were allowed to roam freely in the village. They really liked dogs that we would consider mean dogs because they scared away animals, and they scared away strangers. HERZOG: But they weren't considered pets. In fact, in his language, they don't even have a word for pet. And I went to ask him. I said, Nyaga, would you, like, you know, let a dog in your house when you were living in Africa? And he said, no. I said, would you let a dog eat at the table, you know, and, you know, feed him table scraps? He said, no. I said, Nyaga, would you let a dog sleep in your bed? And the look at the horror on his face, it was like if I said, hey, I've got this really cool rat I just caught down at the Hudson River. You want to sleep with it tonight? (LAUGHTER) HERZOG: And, in fact, I recently got some new data on this. So it turns out that in the United States, we have amongst the highest rate of dog ownership in the world. And there are enormous differences between countries in dog ownership. So there's about 250 dogs per thousand people in the United States. And in Egypt, there's about five dogs per thousand people. So these cultural variations in what people - you know, what's acceptable as a pet and what's not is just huge. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I want to spend a moment talking about the relationships that we have with pets in North America. I know that people spend a lot of money on pets, but as I read your book, I was just shocked at how high that number is. How much do we spend on our pets every year, Hal? HERZOG: It's pushing about $80 billion a year right now. It's an enormous amount of money. VEDANTAM: I mean, that's a fleet of aircraft carriers. HERZOG: Yeah. Yeah, it is. And if you even adjusted for inflation, the amount of money that we spent on pets each year in the United States has more than doubled in the last 30 years per capita. VEDANTAM: Wow. HERZOG: The real increase in spending has been at the high end. Gourmet pet food for dogs - I mean, you can buy, you know, food that you would eat. In fact, you know, I tease my wife and I say, what we're going to do is, like, when we get ready for the giant decline is we're going to stock up on dog food and - you know, when the hurricane (ph) comes. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). HERZOG: But it's also things like, you know, pet day cares, pet spas. There's a hotel that has a zen room where you can get your pets a massage. And I don't know what else pets do in a zen room. We're talking about dog parks. We're talking about jeweled collars. We're talking about pet fashion weeks. We're talking about all these things. And the pet food industry, you know, calls this the humanization of pets. And it really has taken off in the last 30 years. Another factor is advertising and publicity by the pet products industry that push the idea that pets are good for people, that if you get a pet, you will be a happier and healthier person. VEDANTAM: Is this actually true, that owning a pet is good for your health and your longevity? HERZOG: We have overwhelming evidence now that for a lot of people, you know, interacting with their pet does have short-term effects on their physiology, lowers their stress, makes them feel better. The question you ask, however, was different. That was are pets really good for our health and make us live longer? And here my answer is that we don't have particularly good evidence for the long-term impact of pets on human health. I have a stack of reprints in my office, which people have found that, you know, people with pets, you know, they sleep better, that they go to the doctor less, that they have better well-being, that they're less lonely, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I have another stack of reprints in my office that says just the opposite, that people with pets are more lonely, that they're more likely to go to the doctor, that they're more likely to drink a lot, that they're more likely to have ulcers. But you never hear about those studies, you know, in the news. They don't make the news. There's very little evidence that pets make people live longer. And one of the problems we have is which direction the causal arrow points. For example, a recent study by the RAND Corporation found that pet owners, in fact, were better off in terms of their psychological and physical health than non-pet owners. But as they pointed out, so are people with Mercedes-Benzes. People with pets tend to be wealthier. They tend to be younger. They tend to live in nicer places. In other words, the socioeconomic factors may be that it's not that pets are making people happier and healthier. It's that happier, healthier people are more likely to have pets. We have very little data to test those two different hypotheses. VEDANTAM: You present some really striking studies in the book, which talk in some ways of the downside of having pets. You say that some 85,000 Americans are injured each year according to the CDC because they trip over their pets or otherwise are injured by them. And I understand your neighbor Anne (ph) is one of those victims. HERZOG: My neighbor Anne is one of those victims. She's a classic case. She was walking her dog and the leash wrapped around her leg, and she fell over and she broke her collarbone. I recently went on Facebook, and I put a call out - I said if any of you have ever been injured by, you know, a pet by walking your dog, let's say, you know, please write me a note. And I could not believe the response - 80 people responded to me. Many of them were professionals in the field. Some of them even sent me their X-rays, which I - and I was - and some of these incidents were not trivial. Some of these incidents were life-changing. So there are downsides to pet ownership. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So there's a new frontier in pet ownership now, and I want to play you a clip. This is from the company Sony, and they presented this account of a dog at a tech conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Let's start with design. First, the obvious - Aibo is adorable. He wags his tail, wiggles his ears, blinks his eyes and even does that doggy smile - you know that smile that dogs do when you scratch them just right and they kind of tilt their head and half close their eyes and they open their mouth a little and smile. Yeah, that smile. VEDANTAM: So, of course, Hal, Aibo isn't a real dog. Aibo is a robot, and it really looks like humans are completely indiscriminate when it comes to who we will consider and what we will consider to be pets. HERZOG: Yeah. The thing about Aibo - Aibo's got an interesting history. Sony originally developed Aibo and Aibo's a robotic dog, and it does all kind of things. It'll fetch. It'll signal you its emotions. It'll respond when you call its name. The problem with Aibo is that it's metal and shiny, so it doesn't have fur. So while Aibo had some real - it was expensive. It originally cost about 2,000 bucks. It didn't catch on initially. But Aibo was recently resurrected by Sony, and I've looked at the new promotional videos of Aibo, and I'm ready - I'm about ready to get one. It looks pretty good. Oh, and there have been studies where they've taken Aibo and some other types of robotic pets into things like nursing homes and - to see if they had the same impact on, you know, people living in nursing homes in terms of morale and well-being as they do a real dog. VEDANTAM: Right. HERZOG: And the results have been sort of mixed, but in some of the cases, Aibo has actually done better in some cases than an actual animal. VEDANTAM: And some of this, I'm guessing, might have to do with the fact that Aibo doesn't have some of the downsides that owning a real dog might have. Aibo is not going to bark uncontrollably at night or bark at your friends when they come over for a party. I mean, dogs and cats and pets can sometimes induce stress within families and emotional and psychological problems within households. HERZOG: Absolutely, they can. The other thing that Aibo doesn't do is raise the pesky ethical questions that come with pet ownership. You don't have to worry about the ethics of depriving Aibo of a sex life by castrating him. You don't have to worry about the ethics of leaving Aibo alone for long periods of time while you're at your office during the day. You don't have to take Aibo for a walk three times a day and then pick up poop as you walk it down the road. So I think Aibo's got some real advantages. VEDANTAM: So besides the many animals that you own that we've already talked about, you also own a cat whose name is Tilly. And you have what other cat owners might think is a rather idiosyncratic way of expressing your affection for Tilly. In the book you write, don't feel bad, Tilly. I love you even if you are a socially constructed parasite. Really, Hal? HERZOG: (Laughter) Yeah. The question is is she a parasite? And this is the view that pets are basically a form of evolutionarily what's called nest parasitism, which we see in birds. So, for example, let's take the cowbird. What a cowbird does is it lays its eggs in another bird's nest - let's say a wren's nest - and it then flies away and leaves its eggs for this wren to hatch. The wren then sits on the egg until it hatches and so that the wren winds up raising the bird up - the baby of another species. And that's what - that's how we got Tilly. What happened is, you know, this little kitten showed up one day on our doorstep. I was away. I came home and my wife had this strange grin on her face. And I thought, you know, that - you know, I've never quite seen that look. What it is that? She had this grin. And she says, come here, come here, come here. And she shows me this lovely little cat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: And we were hooked. We were hooked. So what did we do? We've been raising Tilly ever since. You know, we've basically been conned by Tilly's mom to take care of her nestling, you know? We don't share any genes with Tilly, but yet the average pet owner over the life of the pet will invest roughly $10,000 in their pet. So we have $10,000 worth of nest parasite living with us. And we get our money's worth out of her. VEDANTAM: Or you think you get your money's worth because, of course, it's the parasite that's having the last laugh. HERZOG: Yeah (laughter) absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When we come back - how the contradictions in the ways we think about animals lead to paradoxes in how we treat them. Hal Herzog is a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University. He's the author of the book \"Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard To Think Straight About Animals.\" Hal, the contradictions in the way we think about animals lead to paradoxes and moral dilemmas in how we treat them. Let's look at the very, very simplest case. Millions of Americans like yourself own a cat. They care for their pet. They say they love animals. But you simultaneously say that loving your cat means subjecting other animals to suffering. How so? HERZOG: My cat's a serial killer. She is an indoor-outdoor cat. And so when she wants to go outside, I let her outside. And what she does some of the time is kill small animals, sometimes birds, more often it's small mice, voles, creatures like that. I am actually more conflicted by being a cat owner than I am over any other aspect of my relationships with animals. VEDANTAM: And, of course, the cat is doing what comes naturally to the cat. The cat is a predator. You can't expect the cat to be behaving any different. But the fact that millions of Americans own cats mean that in some ways they're at least indirectly sanctioning this mass murder of, for example, you know, songbirds. HERZOG: Yeah, and mass murder it is. Depending on the statistics, somewhere between 1 billion and 5 billion birds each year are killed by our pet cats. Furthermore, cats are obligate carnivores. They have to eat meat. And so I've got lots of friends that are vegetarians and vegans, and they're morally opposed to eating meat, but yet they keep cats and they have to buy animal flesh to keep their cats happy and healthy. It's a big moral problem for some people. VEDANTAM: You ran sort of the calculations on this, and you described them in the book. Mathematically, a cat consumes about two ounces of meat a day. That's about 50 pounds of meat a year. By contrast, snakes only consume maybe 5 pounds of meat a year, so the impact of having a cat - the moral impact, if you will - is 10 times greater than the moral impact of owning a snake. And yet, of course, most animal lovers will be horrified if you were to suggest replacing kittens with snakes or maybe even, as we discussed, feeding kittens to boa constrictors. HERZOG: Yeah. I actually developed this scale one time. I was interested in this issue, and I developed the scale, which I called the feeding kittens to boa constrictor scale. I was actually trying to make fun of psychological scales, but it turned out to produce some very interesting things. So, for example, most of my students that I gave this scale to said that it was OK to feed mice to boa constrictors, but it was not OK to feed mice to cats, which was interesting enough. And when I asked them, well, why - you know, why is it OK to feed mice to a boa constrictor but not a cat, one of my students put it perfectly. She said, if my cat ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. And that, to me, gets at this whole thing about what we project onto the animals that we lived with. You know, if my cats ate mice, she wouldn't be like me. Well, she's not like you, girl, you know? VEDANTAM: But in some ways, bringing sort of cat food home just like you bring your own groceries home allows that student, in some ways, to preserve that illusion, doesn't it? HERZOG: Absolutely. She's preserving the illusion. She's preserving the illusion. Now, if I were a better person, perhaps I would keep my cat indoors, which is a lot - what a lot of my friends tell me is I should make her an indoor cat. Well, I resist doing that and my reasoning is probably equally fallacious - is that, if I were a cat, I would rather be an indoor-outdoor cat than a cat that lives in a big cage and spends its day looking outside through the window at the birds floating around. Now, I know that by letting my cat go outdoors, I subject her to the tough things in the wild. In other words, she could get eaten by a coyote. She can't get hit by a car because we live on a road that doesn't have any cars go down it. But the life of an indoor-outdoor cat tends to be shorter, even though she's had a long and good life. But I can't completely justify doing that because of the toll she takes on the small animal life. But I live with it. VEDANTAM: So the more we think of animals as sort of members of our family, the more we think of them as being like us, in some ways, this raises a profound moral paradox - does it not? - which is that, if we actually think of these animals as being like us, how in the world can we, you know, in any good conscience, confine them to our homes, confine them to cages, treat them as if they were our captives to do with as we please? HERZOG: Well, I think that's a great point. It's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. And I've really quite seriously been thinking about, is it ethical to keep animals as pets? If we really think of them as autonomous beings, what right do we have to take away all their autonomy by controlling every aspect of their life? - what they eat, where they go, when they go. And increasing, we're taking control of their genes, which created its own problems. And so I'm thinking, increasingly, that - I'm wondering about the ethics of keeping animals as pets. To me, the logic of pet keeping is not that different than the logic of meat eating. I eat meat. And I know the arguments against it are good and they're better than my argument for eating meat, which is, basically, I like the way it tastes. Well, I feel the same way about my cat. I love my cat, but she carries with her a moral burden. And it's my moral burden. It's not her moral burden. I'm the moral agent. I'm the adult in the room. And I'm the one that has to deal with thinking about this stuff. Although, most people conveniently repress it and don't think about it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: I'm wondering, Hal, in some ways - as you're pointing out - these contradictions are unresolvable. And given the contradictions that you've laid out and the paradoxes of being a pet owner, some of the moral costs that come with being a pet owner, if your current animals - you were to lose them, if they were to die, would you get replacements for them today? HERZOG: Boy, that's a great question. That is such a tough question. I've thought about it. I definitely would not get a dog. I miss having a dog, actually. My wife and I are both dog people. But we haven't had a dog for 10 years and it's because our lifestyle doesn't lend itself - I don't think a dog would be happy living in our house because we're away too much during the day. I can't stand the idea of leaving them in a kennel. Our cat's happy to live by herself. And I think the answer is yes. I think the answer is that I would get another cat. VEDANTAM: The moral dilemmas of pet ownership pale in comparison to the moral dilemmas posed by our use of animals in sport and as food. Hal explores some of the deepest contradictions we have toward animals by looking at the sport of cockfighting. HERZOG: First of all, cockfighting is more illegal now than it was when I was doing that work, but it's just as brutal now. So basically, in a cockfight, what - you have two chickens and you have two handlers and you have a referee and a pit, which is roughly 15 feet in diameter. The referee says pit them. The handlers let them go. And the two roosters try and kill each other. One rooster, almost invariably, dies because they have gaffs, which are basically knives attached to their legs. And it's basically about gambling. There's money changing hands. And so I entered this clandestine world and lived in that clandestine world for a couple of years. VEDANTAM: Now, anyone who hears what you've just described would say, all right, this is morally unconscionable. We cannot allow this to happen. We need to ban this sport. And it has been banned in all parts of the country and many parts of the world. But tell me a little bit more about what happens when you look more closely at the life of one of these roosters that's raised for cockfighting. And you contrast this, in some ways, with the life of your average broiler chicken. HERZOG: Yeah. Well, first I want to say that I do not justify cockfighting. Everything you said about it is correct. It is brutal. It is unjustified. It's now banned throughout the United States. And it should be banned throughout the United States. I'm not trying to justify to - you know, for me, as I started studying cockfighters and how they thought, I became really interested in their moral worlds. And I also began to ask myself some difficult questions. And one of the difficult questions was, if I were a chicken - if I come back in the next world as a chicken, would I rather be an east Tennessee gamecock or would I rather be a McNugget; in other words, a chicken raised in a broiler house to become a McNugget. And to me, there is no doubt in my mind I would much rather be a gamecock than a chicken destined to be served at McDonald's. VEDANTAM: Can you describe to me how you reached that conclusion? What is the life of that gamecock? And what is the life of that chicken that ends up as a McNugget? HERZOG: OK. First, let's take a gamecock. They live long lives. And they live lives that are generally - compared to a broiler chicken - pretty darn amazing. They live, on average, two years. They're not usually fought until they're two years old. For a chunk of their life, they live in free range or they have way more room than a broiler chicken. They're fed incredibly well - a varied diet. They get plenty of exercise. If they win a couple fights, they will use them as a stud rooster. And what they'll do is they'll spend their life chasing the hens around. Not a bad deal. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: On the other hand, the life of a broiler chicken is absolutely horrendous. Their life only lasts between six and seven weeks. They're basically meat machines, which means that they put on weight so fast that their legs can't really hold up their bodies. And so they have chronic leg pain, who's been called the world's largest animal welfare problem. They're jammed into giant broiler houses with 30,000 chicks in a broiler house, where they'll never see the sun. They'll never get to play on the grass. They'll never get to peck at bugs. Their lungs will be burned with ammonia. It's an absolutely horrendous existence. And they will die a pretty lousy death. They'll be crammed into a series of cages. They'll be hauled, for miles, in an open truck, jammed into small little cages with their feathers flying down the interstate, where they will be hung upside down by their legs, dipped into an electrified water bath to stun them. And then they'll go through a carotid artery set of blades that will, hopefully, kill them quickly - although, oftentimes, it does not. So the life of a (laughter) the life of a gamecock, oddly, is vastly better than the life of the 9 billion chickens that Americans eat each year. VEDANTAM: I mean, that is a billion with a B. HERZOG: Yeah. VEDANTAM: You write in the book, while Americans will sleep easy at night knowing cockfighting is banned in all 50 states, 35 million chickens will be stuffed into wire crates on their way to processing plants tomorrow. That makes you... HERZOG: Yeah. That's in one day. VEDANTAM: That makes you think, doesn't it? HERZOG: Yeah. Absolutely does. When I began doing my research on the comparative cruelty of cockfighting (laughter) versus McNuggets, I was stunned. I mean, I just - I was absolutely stunned. And I realized, you know, cockfighting should be illegal, but the casual chicken eater is committing a bigger sin in their own way than is the rooster fighter. And by the way, rooster fighters love their animals. That was one of the things I had a hard time wrapping my head around. It was like, these guys really love chickens. VEDANTAM: The comedian Chris Rock once went on David Letterman and talked about some of the contradictions in the way we think about animals. He contrasted the football player Michael Vick, who went to prison for promoting dogfighting, with the former governor of Alaska and hunting enthusiast Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\") CHRIS ROCK: And she's shooting mooses. And she got the moose. (LAUGHTER) ROCK: Holding a dead, bloody moose. (LAUGHTER) ROCK: And Michael Vick's like, why am I in jail? (LAUGHTER) ROCK: What the hell? But you let a white lady shoot a moose. (LAUGHTER) DAVID LETTERMAN: Yeah. ROCK: Black man want to kill a dog, that's a crime. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: It does sound like a double standard, Hal. HERZOG: Yeah, it does sound like a double standard. We see the same thing in lots of areas of human-animal interactions. So for example, take cockfighting - cockfighting is a sport of lower-socioeconomic-status whites and Hispanics. And on the other hand, compare that with the sport of kings, horseracing. Horseracing is finally coming under the gun. In the last couple months, as you probably know, I think almost 30 animals were killed at the Santa Anita racetrack in California. And this has been going on for years and years and years. A number of thoroughbred horses that die, numbers in the thousands and thousands each year. But yet, very few people get bent out of shape about horseracing compared to cockfighting. VEDANTAM: So it is a class thing in some ways, isn't it? HERZOG: Very much so. Very much so. It's a class thing. VEDANTAM: We started this conversation, Hal, by talking about some stories and paradoxes and contradictions from your own life, and I want to end the conversation in the same way. When you were in grad school, you were once asked to put a number of different creatures into boiling water. Why were you asked to do this? And walk me through what happened. HERZOG: Yeah. I was working in a chemical ecology lab. And we were interested in the chemical perceptions of - in this case it was reptiles snakes - baby snakes. And we basically were interested in whether or not these animals were born with an instinctive preference for certain types of foods. And, of course, they eat live animals. So in this case, there was another researcher in Utah that was interested in doing similar research for his dissertation. And he sent our lab, basically, a menagerie. It came in a big box, which basically said, this side up. Live animals. And the box contained an array of animals. It contained worms, crickets. It contained some scorpions. It contained a lizard. It contained another snake. It contained - and then a mouse. And so I was the lowest ranking member of the lab. So they assigned me to basically convert these animals to a solution that could be dabbed on a swab and exposed to these snakes. And so the procedure involves dropping these animals into water that was not quite boiling. And I thought, OK, I'll do it. And I had dropped the first one in that I think was a cricket. And it just died instantly. And then I did the Scorpion, which was a bigger animal. And it didn't die so quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HERZOG: And then I had to do the, as I recall, it was a lizard. And, you know, I like lizards. I like reptiles. And it was not good. You know, it took much longer time for the lizard to die in the water. And I was getting upset. And then I was working my way up the phylogenetic scale. And then there was the mouse. It was a cute little mouse. It wasn't a lab mouse. It was one of these cute little woodland mice. And I took a look at the mouse and as I recall, I actually picked it up, was getting ready to drop it in the water and I just couldn't do it. And I just put the mouse back in its cage. And I went and told the lab manager, I can't do this. Somebody else is going to have to do it. That just haunted me for a very long time. And it really was the event that got me on this journey that I've been on for more than 30 years now about trying to understand why it was so easy to do the cricket and harder to do the lizard and I couldn't do the mouse. And, you know, I've never come to grips with it, but I've been chasing that down. It really is the thing that got me thinking about the psychology of human-animal interactions and why we treat some animals different than other. VEDANTAM: So one way that people justify eating meat and treating animals the way they do is that they believe that there's a status hierarchy between animals and it's along the lines of what happened in your lab. So worms are lower on the scale than scorpions. Scorpions are lower on the scale than mice. You once watched the Steven Spielberg movie \"E.T.\" with your daughter. And you came up with a thought experiment that probably ruined the movie for her. HERZOG: (Laughter) Actually, it was my twin daughters, they were both there. And probably most listeners are aware of what happens at the end of the movie. So E.T. and Elliott are running around California. They're buddies for, you know, the previous two hours. And at the end, E.T.'s mom comes back to get him in the flying saucer. And E.T., with that great big head and big eyes, looks at Elliott and he says - he croaks, he goes... (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\") PAT WELSH: (As E.T.) Come. HERZOG: You know, like, you know, come with me. We'll go back to Zork and we'll have a great time, you know. And Elliott says, no. I can't do it. I'm going to stay here. And E.T. takes off, you know and goes back to Zork and it's all good. And (laughter) my daughters - I don't know what I was thinking. I said, hey, girls, what if E.T. wanted Elliott to go back to Zork with him? And so he grabs Elliott... (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\") HERZOG: ...And he drags him screaming into the flying saucer because they want to use Elliott in a research experiment. They want to use him in an experiment because there's like this AIDS-like virus invading the people of Zork. And the Zorkians are much smarter than Americans. They're much smarter than Elliott. Would it be OK for E.T. to kidnap Elliott and take him and use him in biomedical research experiment? And my kids, they're horrified. No, dad. No. No. And I thought the same thing. No, that would not be a good idea. But on the other hand, what I realized was that our use of animals in biomedical research is based on the same premise. You know, we're smarter than other creatures. We're way smarter than mice. We're way smarter than dogs. We're somewhat smarter than chimpanzees in our own ways. And that's our justification for using animals in biomedical research. And I was forced to the conclusion that, look; if we're going to use animals in research, we got to let E.T. take Elliott back to Zork and use him in a cage. Obviously, it's the same sort of thought experiment that I did when I concluded we ought to feed kittens to boa constrictors, you know? But I still can't wrap my head around that. My heart's telling me one thing, even though logic is telling me something else. And that's the gist of a lot of our inconsistencies with our interactions with animals.

        "texts": "Shankar Vedantam Parth Shah Thomas Lu Tara Boyle Maggie Penman The nastiness of American politics today may seem extreme compared to the tone of earlier eras. But historian David Moss says our nation's founders were also happy to sling mud. Thomas Jefferson's supporters said John Adams had a \"hideous hermaphroditical character.\" Adams called Alexander Hamilton that \"bastard brat of a Scotch peddler.\" Beyond the noxious language, there were also deep disagreements about what it meant to be a nation. Moss argues that the intensity of our partisan disagreements shouldn't be cause for alarm. He believes our democracy is much more resilient than we realize, and that conflict, however bitter, can be productive. \"I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect, but it is extraordinarily resilient, and it has generated tremendous progress,\" he says. That said, Moss also believes that Americans should ask a key question as we assess the health of our political discourse: do the politicians you support ever put democracy in second place at the expense of a partisan battle? \"It's good, I think, in a democracy to be hypochondriacs - that is, to think that, oh, our system might be sick. Because when you think it might be sick, you start to take some action to try to fix it.\" That's in the second half of this week's show. In the first part of our program, we revisit our 2018 conversation with political scientist John Hibbing. Over the years, he has studied how our political views may be influenced by our biology. \"We would look at brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative, just on the basis of that,\" he says.
