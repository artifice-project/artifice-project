        "title": "Trump's Racist Rhetoric Takes America Back Again : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The president's racist tweets tapped into one of the oldest strains in American politics - the fear and vilification of people perceived as other. That could be people of color, immigrants or, really, anyone unlike the speaker. NPR editor and correspondent Ron Elving is here to talk with us about this history. Hi, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Ari. SHAPIRO: You wrote on NPR.org that President Trump with his comments to the Democratic congresswomen was, quote, \"taking America back to where it came from.\" What do you mean by that? ELVING: I'm playing on the words of the president saying that these members of Congress should go back where they came from. SHAPIRO: Sure. ELVING: Nativism is as American as apple pie, Ari. It has been with us back to the early days of the republic. There was feeling against foreign-born citizens even then. They put it in the Constitution that a foreign-born person couldn't ever be president of the United States. And it took on a different form as more and more people did arrive from other countries, and people became fearful of those waves of immigration. SHAPIRO: And that extends beyond people who were born in other countries to people who are perceived as other. Three of the four congresswomen here are born in the U.S. ELVING: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: What were the peak periods of American nativism throughout U.S. history? ELVING: There were surges at several points in our history, beginning in the 1830s and 1940s, when famine and political upheaval in Ireland and Germany sent a huge influx of people into the country. And these people were Catholic, whereas most of the Americans at that time were Protestant, overwhelmingly. And also, they were arriving in such numbers that they disturbed people. So we go from fewer than 2 million foreign-born people at one point in the 1840s to, suddenly, within the decade, twice that many. And that was seen as fearful. It was seen as taking away jobs. But it was also seen as a threat to people's social order. And then, of course, you get another wave toward the end of the 1800s, early 1900s that came from all other parts of Europe - Eastern Europe, southern Europe. And in the 1920s, nativist feeling was so strong they passed a very restrictive immigration act in 1924, and they ignored the results of a census that showed these big influxes of immigrants had made the cities more populous than the countryside. SHAPIRO: And during these periods that there were all of these attacks on immigrants, did you also see attacks on people like the congresswomen today who are not immigrants, but are perceived as being different, just in the same way that President Trump in one breath attacks people crossing the border from Mexico and in another breath attacks people born in the U.S. who are brown or black? ELVING: The identification here of people who are different from whatever the perception of the old American, the true American - that's really what's crucial here. It really doesn't depend where you came from if you are perceived as being the other - for example, people who moved north in the Great Migration of African Americans in the 20th century, leaving behind the Southern states, moving to the north. And they were marginalized, and they were put in ghettos. And they were denied many of the opportunities of society and perceived as the other, even though they had been in the United States, at that point, for generations and generations. SHAPIRO: We've seen so many prominent figures use this kind of demonizing rhetoric. How unusual is it for a president? ELVING: Well, Calvin Coolidge, back in the 1920s, spoke of America becoming a dumping ground for undesirable people from other countries. So you have that kind of ugliness that far back. Richard Nixon had a very strong appeal to what he called the silent majority. He was clearly trying to speak to the sentiments of the white working class of his time, as opposed to both immigrant groups and also people of color in general. And then you have Ronald Reagan's approach, which was rather different. And in the immigration bill of 1986 - that reform bill actually granted amnesty to millions of people who were in the country without proper documents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: I'm going to do everything I can - and all of us in the administration are - to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. ELVING: And he thought it would finally give the United States full control of its borders. The amnesty worked, but it didn't really create the sort of border control that President Reagan thought it would. And it didn't do that much to discourage employers from bringing in and exploiting immigrant workers. SHAPIRO: So what stands out to you about President Trump's tapping this vein of American sentiment as being different from his predecessors? ELVING: Couple of things - one thing is that he personalizes it so much to individual people who are such high-identification citizens themselves - people who have actually been elected to Congress. That is highly unusual for a president of the United States. And also, it seems that even in Trump's own personal history as a politician - that he's gone from the birtherism when he was strongly suggesting that President Obama had not been born in the United States. That was, if you will, relatively subtle compared to where he was over this past weekend where he was highly personalizing and - if you will, the mask on his not only nativist sentiments, but racist. SHAPIRO: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks a lot, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "texts": "Guy Raz dives into the stories behind some of the world's best known companies. How I Built This weaves a narrative journey about innovators, entrepreneurs and idealists\u2014and the movements they built. July 15, 2019 \u2022 In the early 1990s, Susan Griffin-Black was working for Esprit in San Francisco. On a business trip to London, she walked into a Covent Garden apothecary shop, picked up a bottle of lavender oil and took a whiff. The aroma \u2014 \"like being in a beautiful garden\" \u2014 literally changed her life. That was the inspiration to develop her own line of essential oil products. For 15 years, she and her husband and co-founder Brad Black barely scraped by, but the business eventually thrived. And though their marriage ultimately ended, their partnership continues. PLUS for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" Lia Heifetz of Barnacle Foods describes how she and her partners turned Alaskan bull kelp into pickles and salsa. July 8, 2019 \u2022 In 1989, college senior Wendy Kopp was trying to figure out how to improve public education in the US. For her senior thesis, she proposed creating a national teaching corps that would recruit recent college grads to teach in needy schools.

        "texts": "Shankar Vedantam uses science and storytelling to reveal the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior, shape our choices and direct our relationships. Our voices convey so much more than just information. They can tell other people something essential about who we are. Angela Hsieh hide caption July 15, 2019 \u2022 At some point in our lives, many of us realize that the way we hear our own voice isn't the way others hear us. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at the relationship between our voices and our identities. Plus, we hear how advances in technology might help people with vocal impairments, and consider the ethical quandaries that arise when we can create personalized, customized voices. Psychologist Phil Tetlock thinks the parable of the fox and the hedgehog represents two different cognitive styles. \"The hedgehogs are more the big idea people, more decisive,\" while the foxes are more accepting of nuance, more open to using different approaches with different problems. Renee Klahr hide caption July 8, 2019 \u2022 The Greek poet Archilochus wrote that \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" This week, we'll use the metaphor of the fox and the hedgehog as a way to understand the differences between tacticians and big-picture thinkers. We'll explore the story of a pioneering surgeon whose hedgehog tendencies led him to great triumphs, and a heartbreaking tragedy. This episode first aired in May 2017. July 1, 2019 \u2022 All of us are surrounded by brands. Designer brands. Bargain-shopper brands. Brands for seemingly every demographic slice among us. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself how brands influence you? This week, we look at how companies create a worldview around the products they sell, and then get us to make those products a part of who we are. June 24, 2019 \u2022 More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017 \u2014 many of them from heroin and other opioids. One of the most widely-used tools to confront this crisis is a drug called naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose within seconds, and has been hailed by first responders and public health researchers. But in 2018, two economists released a study that suggested naloxone might be leading some users to engage in riskier behavior \u2014 and causing more deaths than it saves. This week, we talk with researchers, drug users, and families about the mental calculus of opioid use, and why there's still so much we're struggling to understand about addiction. This episode originally aired in October 2018. Hal Herzog, a professor of psychology at Western Carolina University, says the more we attribute humanlike qualities to animals, the more ethically problematic it may be to keep them as pets. Angela Hsieh/NPR hide caption June 17, 2019 \u2022 Does living with animals really make us healthier? Why do we eat some animals and keep others as pets? This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with psychology professor Hal Herzog about the contradictions embedded in our relationships with animals. Modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of Narcissus in us. Most of us like people who remind us of ourselves \u2014 whether that is someone else with the same name or the same birthday. Renee Klahr/NPR hide caption June 10, 2019 \u2022 Are women named Virginia more likely to move to Virginia? Are people with the last name of Carpenter more likely to be carpenters? This week on Hidden Brain, we bring you a favorite 2017 episode about our preference for things that remind us of ourselves, and why this tendency can have larger implications than we might at first imagine. A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services. Angela Hsieh hide caption June 3, 2019 \u2022 Generations of Americans have struggled against segregation. Most of us believe in the ideal of a colorblind society. But what happens when that ideal come up against research that finds colorblindness sometimes leads to worse outcomes? May 27, 2019 \u2022 Many of us intuitively feel that the bitter partisanship of American politics is bad for our nation. So should we be concerned about the health of our democracy? This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit two of our favorite conversations about U.S. politics. We start by talking with political scientist John Hibbing about the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. Then, we explore the role of conflict in democracy with historian David Moss. May 20, 2019 \u2022 It happens to all of us: someone recognizes you on the street, calls you by name, and says hello. You, meanwhile, have no idea who that person is. Researchers say this struggle to read other faces is common. This week on Hidden Brain, we revisit a favorite 2016 episode about \"super-recognizers\" and the rest of us. New research suggests that early investments in children's education can have benefits that last for more than one generation. Angela Hsieh hide caption May 13, 2019 \u2022 Smarts matter. But other factors may play an even bigger role in whether someone succeeds. This week, we speak with Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman about the skills that predict how you'll fare in life. We'll also look at programs that build these skills in the neediest of children \u2013 and new research that suggests the benefits of investing in kids and families can last for generations.

        "title": "Steve Bullock, Montana Governor And 2020 Candidate, Vows To Tackle 'Dark Money' : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "NOEL KING, HOST: Montana Governor Steve Bullock started his presidential campaign late, and so he missed the first Democratic primary debate. His campaign says he's qualified for the next round later this month. Now, at the center of his campaign is dark money. In the latest installment of MORNING EDITION's Opening Arguments series, our policy conversations with 2020 candidates, Bullock says he thinks anonymous money from corporations and lobbying groups has corrupted our democratic process. And he started with an example. STEVE BULLOCK: Think about the first George Bush. George H.W. Bush said we will lead on climate change, and we'll lead from the top. That was 30 years ago. And now Republicans can't even acknowledge that climate change is human caused or real because of the outside spending in our elections. If we can't take care of the corrupting influence of money in our elections, everything else that the Democrats are talking about, we're going to run into the same problem. KING: Can I just ask what reforms you would make specifically on dark money? Like, what are your plans? BULLOCK: So Day 1, I'd sign an executive order that says if you want a contract with the federal government I can't tell you, you can't spend or donate, but you have to disclose every single dollar that you are either spending are donating to influence our elections. Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference. My legislature was about two-thirds Republican when we passed a bill that said 90 days out from election, you have to disclose every nickel that you spend. Never forget, when I was running for reelection, Day 90, all of that dark money spending stopped. And if we could kick the Koch brothers or other groups out of Montana, we ought to be able do it everywhere in the country. KING: Let's turn to foreign policy, which is something that, as a governor, you haven't had a tremendous amount of experience with. Would you end U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen? BULLOCK: I would. What's happened in Yemen has been failed from the beginning. So I think that we actually need to actually be withdrawing the U.S. dollars but try to bring the U.N. in together for more of a peacekeeping role. KING: Would you withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan? BULLOCK: I would want to make sure that we are completely out by the end of my first term. KING: 2024? BULLOCK: 2024. KING: You are one of just four Democratic candidates in a very large field not to pledge that you will not take money from the fossil fuel industry. Why not? BULLOCK: Well, I've - and look, the overall efforts in trying to make sure that all money's disclosed has been the fight of my career. And what I've said from the beginning is I'll disclose every single dollar that's donated to my campaign with full transparency. No PAC money. No corporate money. But haven't said this industry or that industry. We just won't accept dollars. KING: But why not? BULLOCK: To be candid, I don't even know if I've gotten one nickel from anybody in the fossil fuel industry. We could certainly check and get back to you. But it's just - if it's an individual giving a donation, I'm not going to put these lines around, here's who's worthy to give and who's worthy not to give. And I also think that there's something about this, too. Like, you know, Montana's a coal state. KING: Yeah. BULLOCK: We have to take immediate and durable action on climate change. But I think at times, Democrats will turn around and say - you know, folks, this example that it powered this country for their whole lives and worked hard - at times, there's a perception that Democrats think something's wrong with those individuals. So I think that we have to be careful, especially the workers, that we're not demonizing what they've chosen to do to actually feed their family. But we're trying to make this transition fast. KING: You said we should rejoin the Paris climate deal. We should note that even if the signatories to that deal meet their goals, which they're not on track to do, global temperatures will still rise over what scientists refer to as the threshold of catastrophe. What else will you do to make sure that doesn't happen? BULLOCK: You bet. And the scientists say we have to be net-zero emissions, carbon neutral, as a world by 2050. I think we could do it by 2040, or even earlier. KING: If you were the president, how? What's your plan? BULLOCK: We need to make federal investments in everything from those opportunities upgrading the grid to investing in agriculture. There's sustainable agriculture, and the Dairy Council's examples, already saying here's how they can be net-zero emissions. We can't do this alone. As you know, China emits twice as much as we do. We know that we have to take about a billion tons of CO2 out a year if we're going to actually meet these targets. And I think bringing together everybody from conservationists, to labor to utilities and say let's actually make this track an opportunity. KING: You are an interesting candidate in a very specific way. You're a politician whose mind has changed on a very real topic, which is gun control. You used to not support a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. But you changed your mind, and now you do. What year did you change your mind? BULLOCK: '17 or '18 is when I said universal background checks. It was just last year on assault weapons. KING: That puts you behind a lot of the country, though. And I wonder why that is? BULLOCK: Yeah. KING: Why'd it take you so long? BULLOCK: So we had a \"March For Our Lives\" in Helena, in Montana. I was asked to speak and supposed to speak. I went with my children, and I listened. And as these kids are saying, enough. That's where I finally said, enough with the assault weapons. Because I know as a gun owner. I know that it's not for hunting. I know it's not for self-defense. There's no reason to continue to sell these. KING: When you talk about dark money, you talk about how Americans are supposed to count equally and that dark money sort of perverts that. There is a norm that you are very clearly seeking to return to in the United States. But I wonder, what do you think American democracy looks like in the wake of the Trump presidency? Are there norms to return to, or has this country changed forever? BULLOCK: There has to be. I mean, I think that we are at a tenuous time in this 243-year experiment called representative democracy. And that's one of the reasons why I got into this because I think that things fundamentally change if this guy is reelected. The norms and expectations, and the behavior that's been normalized, and the lies and the misstatements that divide us by race, by gender, by geography, I think that there are norms to be returned to. And I think that we've got to make sure that people know that they're as important as any corporation on Election Day, and every one of us have the same amount of influence over elections. That's how we make sure that the norms are restored, that people feel like that they have a role and a voice in this representative democracy. KING: Montana Governor Steve Bullock, thanks so much. BULLOCK: Thank you so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Harris and Biden will again share center stage in the July 31 debate. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders is in the middle as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris face off in the June 27 debate in Miami. Harris and Biden will again share center stage in the July 31 debate. The lineup is now set for the second series of Democratic presidential primary debates, at the end of the month. On the first night, progressive favorites Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be on stage together for the first time, while upstart South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg will be trying to continue his improbable rise. On the second night, the marquee matchup will likely again be former Vice President Joe Biden versus California Sen. Kamala Harris, who had a nasty back-and-forth during their initial debate over Biden's past opposition to busing in some instances. It is also notable that with race playing such a big role not just this past week in politics with President Trump, but also in this Democratic campaign, that all of the candidates of color ended up being on stage together on the second night. That will make for odd optics on Night 1 and also potentially creates a difficult position for Biden, given the exchange over school integration in the first debate. The debates will be held on July 30 and 31 in Detroit from 8 to 10 ET each night. Moderators will be CNN's Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. Candidates for the July 30 debate: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and author Marianne Williamson Candidates for the July 31 debate: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and entrepreneur Andrew Yang Loading... NBC News, which hosted the first series of debates last month, also held a random drawing in order to determine the debate stage pairings, but it was held off stage and without much fanfare. CNN, however, hyped the potential face-offs to the highest drama, showing reporters shuffling names and then doing each drawing live (including from an overhead camera). The network did make sure with their lottery that the candidate division would be more equitable, based on polling, across both nights. The network divided the candidates into three buckets and drew participants from each \u2014 the four top-tier candidates (Biden, Harris, Sanders and Warren); mid-range hopefuls (Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Yang); and candidates who are mired near the bottom (Bennet, Bullock, de Blasio, Delaney, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Inslee, Ryan and Williamson). In order to make the debate, Democratic hopefuls had to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate had to register at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have reached 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both criteria. Major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just jumped in the contest last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who last week reversed his initial decision to pass on the race, also didn't qualify, given their late announcements. However, the benchmarks will get harder for the next debate in September. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "title": "Democrat Calls For Investigation Into Viral Russian-Developed FaceApp : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST: If you've seen photos of friends or celebrities posting selfies with silver hair and wrinkles lately, it's not the relentless news cycle. They probably used FaceApp. The app can make your face look older, younger, even style your hair. It can be fun, but lawmakers warn users to take precaution. The Democratic National Committee warned presidential campaigns against using it, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on the FBI to investigate. He posted this on social media about FaceApp. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: It allows, quote, \"perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license to your photos, name or likeness.\" So this is a breathtaking and possibly dangerous level of access. SIMON: Louise Matsakis is a staff writer at Wired magazine and joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us. LOUISE MATSAKIS: Thanks for having me. SIMON: In your judgment, is FaceApp really more compromising than Facebook or Instagram, who have billions of users already? MATSAKIS: Absolutely not. I think that one thing to consider here is that this is a much smaller company, and Facebook has argued in the past that they're better at protecting your data because they, you know, inherently have more resources. But I don't think that this FaceApp is necessarily more controversial or troubling because it happens to be made by developers who are Russian. I think that's where kind of the anxiety from lawmakers comes from here. FaceApp, like a lot of these free apps, their business model's around advertising. You know, they're sending some of your data to the Google ad networks. That's what they want here. That doesn't mean it's not troubling for other reasons, but I think lawmakers here are maybe fixating on the wrong issue. SIMON: Why is it troubling for other reasons? MATSAKIS: I think we should be really careful about who we want to share our faces with. This information is really sensitive. It's not something, like Schumer pointed out, that they're going to get back to you. You know, they maintain the rights to these images, and they can do what they want with them. But the reality is we're sharing our facial recognition data with so many companies. And a lot of time, we don't have a lot of control over that. So it's really not just this app, even though it's, you know, called FaceApp, so it seems really literal. But when you upload pictures to dating sites, to Facebook, to, you know, photo-sharing sites like Flickr or Instagram, you're probably in a facial recognition database and you don't know it already. SIMON: I got to tell you. I've been taking pictures of our 16-year-old since she came into our lives. Is it already too late for her? MATSAKIS: Probably. And it's too late for what Georgetown University estimates is probably over half of Americans who are already in a facial recognition database as it stands. You know, that includes when you get a license, right? You know, that license database might be used by the government to create a facial recognition algorithm that includes maybe a dating profile that might be used to identify your gender or something. You know, researchers from Stanford in 2017 actually took photos from a dating network, and they used it to build a very controversial tool that claimed to identify people's sexuality just based on their photo. So, you know, the people who are on that dating site had no idea something like that was going to happen. SIMON: Do companies ever lose control of the data? I mean, that happens with credit card information all the time, doesn't it? MATSAKIS: Sure. And it's not even just losing control. A lot of time, these databases are widely available or they're made public to academic researchers and to corporations in order to foster more scholarship. So a lot of these photos are just out there even if there isn't a data breach to begin with. These big training sets are already available to a, you know, wide array of different actors who want to use them to build tools that they can use to do whatever they want. SIMON: Is there any way to stop this, any way to take steps, even if it's too late to protect your images? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think making sure that your profiles are not public is a good way of doing that. That's really hard because dating profiles, for instance, are inherently public, right? You want other people to see them. But I think really thinking about, do I need to upload this picture right now, is this worth the risk that it poses by uploading it, do I really need to post a lot of pictures of me maybe publicly on Twitter or something like that, or would I rather just have kind of a private Facebook group where I share pictures of my daughter? SIMON: Even if FaceApp isn't as dangerous as some political figures caution, is it good that this conversation - if you please - has been set off? MATSAKIS: Definitely. I think this is really great that this conversation is centering on your face, which is such a valuable piece of data for these companies that are building these algorithms, often for troubling purposes, like law enforcement or that sort of thing, or identifying people and perhaps identifying you. And I think that's really an important part of this conversation, even though maybe this app is a little silly. SIMON: When you say it's troubling that law enforcement could use it, I mean, if you're looking for someone who committed a violent crime against someone you love, you're glad to have that technology. On the other hand, if you're a dissident in Hong Kong, you're not glad to have that technology. MATSAKIS: Exactly. I think these conversations always involve a trade-off between privacy and security. And we kind of haven't really figured out that balance with facial recognition data yet. And I think another concern is that a lot of these algorithms have been proven to be inaccurate. You know, people have been arrested for crimes... SIMON: Yeah. MATSAKIS: ...They didn't commit because the algorithm, you know, mistakenly identified them. So I think that's another piece that's really important here. SIMON: Louise Matsakis of Wired, thanks so much for being with us. MATSAKIS: Thanks again. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

Updated 8:30 p.m. ET President Trump will nominate Eugene Scalia, son of late Justice Antonin Scalia, to be the next labor secretary, the president announced via Twitter Thursday evening. I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor. Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience.... A source close to Scalia earlier Thursday confirmed to NPR that the president had offered Scalia the job and that he accepted. Scalia, 55, is a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, D.C., where he handles cases related to labor and employment. In the early 1990s, Scalia served as a special assistant to Attorney General William Barr during Barr's first stint leading the Justice Department. Scalia also served as the solicitor of the U.S. Labor Department, the agency's top lawyer, during the George W. Bush administration. Current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned effective Friday. Acosta has been caught up in controversy surrounding his handling of a plea deal involving financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein pleaded guilty to felony charges of soliciting minors for prostitution. He also had to register as a sex offender. Epstein is facing new charges in New York of sex trafficking. In 2005, Wal-Mart hired Scalia to defend it against lawsuits from former employees who said they were fired for calling out wrongdoing within the company.

Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images hide caption President Trump continued his attacks on members of Congress during a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., Wednesday night. The racist rhetoric from President Trump attacking four freshmen Democratic women, who he tweeted should \"go back\" to their countries of origin, escalated Wednesday night at his campaign rally in North Carolina. \"Send her back,\" the crowd chanted, during a riff in which the president criticized Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born American citizen from Minnesota. The president stood back for about 13 seconds before continuing on with his speech. He did not comment on the chant, which hearkened back to the anti-Hillary Clinton \"lock her up\" refrain, ubiquitous at 2016 Trump rallies. On Thursday, Trump said he tried to stop it, that he would try to do so in the future and that he disavows the chant. \"I was not happy with it,\" he said when asked about it at the White House. \"I disagree with it.\" But on Friday, Trump seemed to defend his chanting supporters, tweeting, \"It is amazing how the Fake News Media became 'crazed' over the chant,\" but \"is totally calm & accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by\" the congresswomen with whom he has been feuding. He referred to statements by three of lawmakers in his tweet, but there are four in the group \u2014 Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All four are U.S. citizens, and three were born in the United States. What's more, Trump also tweeted twice this week before his rally, \"If you are not happy here, you can leave.\" (Once, he did so in ALL CAPS.) So there appears to be some line of what's acceptable or not in the president's view, but it's relative. The next time that chant, or one like it, comes up at a rally, will Trump try to stop it? That's unclear but may be beside the point. What's clear is that this week highlighted \u2014 once again \u2014 that racial division and identity politics are going to be a major factor in the 2020 campaign and will almost certainly overshadow anything else that comes up. That should come as no surprise. Trump has used white grievance to fuel his political rise \u2014 from his role in the birther movement questioning former President Barack Obama's birth in Hawaii to his campaign kickoff when he said Mexico was sending rapists and drugs to the United States to his outsize focus on limiting immigration. He has used that grievance to sustain him in office \u2014 first, instituting a travel ban on people from countries that his administration deemed a threat (originally, they were all majority-Muslim countries), then wanting to require immigrants to \"speak English,\" to now using the go-back-to-where-you-came-from-if-you-don't-like-it line. And that could be why such a high percentage of Americans strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. This week's controversy also highlights the challenges the president faces in reelection, as he not only tries to find something to rally his base, but also attempt to plant doubt with independents about the direction Democrats want to take the country. Why the effort to elevate the four congresswomen? Trump and his campaign are trying to make the four congresswomen the faces of the Democratic Party. Why? He knows that their liberal policies are at odds with Democratic leadership and unpopular in swing parts of the country, so Trump is trying to tie them together. He noted this week that his attack \"forced\" Democrats to rally around the women. The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four \u201cprogressives,\u201d but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats! For Trump, the choice is binary \u2014 if you defend the four congresswomen in any way, then you endorse all of their statements and policies. That's a slippery slope, but one Trump's campaign is happy to sled down. Just hours before Trump said he was \"not happy\" with the \"send her back\" chant at his rally, his campaign declined to distance itself from it. \"The Squad, as they call themselves, are now the leaders of the Democrat Party,\" campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NPR's Tamara Keith in a statement when asked whether the campaign would disavow it. \"Americans don't like it when elected officials consistently disparage this country. All the Democrats are pushing socialist ideas that are terrible for America. They are all the same.\" Trump's tweet about forcing Democrats to defend the four congresswomen and the campaign's initial response to the rally chant make the political strategy plain. Facing reelection, the president hasn't done much to reach out beyond his loyal base of supporters, who still very much support him, but he needs to win over independents. So he's trying to make them think Democrats and their most extreme wing are one and the same while Democratic presidential candidates duke it out in their primary. In other words, define Trump's eventual opponent as too far left for the country even before there is a nominee. Independents have been a bright red flashing warning light for this president For much of the two-and-a-half years since Trump became president, independents have tracked with Democrats on many issues (except on the question of whether to begin impeachment proceedings). That support from independents helped propel Democrats to take back the House in 2018, and independents are especially vital for Republicans to win in presidential elections. Just how much? Republicans have won independents in seven of the last 11 presidential elections, and they won five of those elections. The 1976 and 2012 races were the exceptions. Mitt Romney won independents by 5 in 2012, but lost the election. In 2016, Trump won them by 4 points, according to exit polls, but lost the popular vote. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. That demonstrates the need, even more so, for Republicans to win independents, who have become a larger share of the electorate \u2013 31% in 2016 versus 26% in 2004. Trump is personally under water with independents. While he saw his highest quarterly approval rating on average this past quarter, according to Gallup \u2014 with an average of about 43% \u2014 that's still lower than his percentage of the vote in 2016 (about 46%). Dragging him down? Just 35% of independents approved of the job he's doing. So it's no surprise that Trump is grasping for something to sway them. The GOP and conservative media have been vilifying Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, in particular \u2013 and a poll, leaked by Democrats, showed just how much Democrats don't want them to be the focus. It found that both Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are fairly well known and unpopular with \"swing voters,\" whites without a college degree in swing House districts. But what else is unpopular with independents and swing voters? Racism, or at least the appearance of it. That could explain why Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the head of the committee tasked with electing Republicans to the House, said at a breakfast with reporters Thursday of the chant, \"There's no place for that kind of talk. I don't agree with that.\" The fact remains that while Democrats are trying to figure out their way forward, Trump also has a lot of work to do to win reelection in 2020. His campaign is banking on another very close election, one that sees a similar path to his victory in 2016. And remember, that only was decided by 78,000 votes across three Upper Midwest states \u2014 and Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. So strap in. This next election is going to be a turbulent ride for a country whose moral fabric is already being stretched perilously thin.

AP hide caption Court documents released Thursday includes details about Donald Trump directing then-lawyer Michael Cohen to help arrange payments to Stormy Daniels and another woman. Updated at 3:14 p.m. ET Donald Trump took part in phone calls with his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen as the attorney and other aides scrambled to arrange hush payments to a woman in 2016 to buy her silence about an alleged sexual relationship with Trump. Those details come from hundreds of pages of court papers \u2014 warrant applications, affidavits and other related materials \u2014 made public on Thursday. Federal Judge William Pauley of the Southern District of New York ordered the documents unsealed after prosecutors said they had concluded their investigation into the scheme and any related campaign finance violations. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges related to payments made shortly before Election Day in 2016 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said that he made the payments in coordination with and at the direction of Trump. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence after he admitted to that and other crimes in court. Cohen remains the only person to be charged in connection with the payments, although two individuals struck nonprosecution agreements with the government in exchange for their testimony. Inside the room While many details about the payments already have been public, the court records released Thursday provide a behind-the-scenes look into how Cohen worked with executives from American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, to make them happen \u2014 and prevent news of Trump's alleged extramarital affairs from getting out ahead of Election Day. Team Trump was particularly desperate to keep a lid on the alleged affairs after news broke of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump uses crude language about touching women. One section of a warrant application filed in April 2018 states that Cohen exchanged a series of calls, text messages and emails with Trump, Clifford's lawyer, Keith Davidson, AMI's David Pecker and Dylan Howard, as well as Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks in the days after the Access Hollywood tape appeared. \"Based on the timing of these calls, and the content of the text messages and emails, I believe that at least some of the communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public, particularly in the wake of the Access Hollywood story,\" the FBI agent wrote in an affidavit supporting the warrant. The agent then details a flurry of calls on Oct. 8, 2016 \u2014 one day after the Access Hollywood tape was revealed in The Washington Post. At around 7:20 p.m., the agent's affidavit says, Cohen received a call from Hicks. \"Sixteen seconds into the call, Trump joined the call, and the call continued for over four minutes,\" it says. The documents then describe a string of calls over the next hour that Cohen made to Hicks, Pecker, Howard and, again, Trump. \"At 8:03 p.m., about three minutes after ending his call with Pecker, Cohen called Trump, and they spoke for nearly eight minutes,\" the papers say. After two more quick calls with Howard, Cohen received a text message from Howard that read: \"Keith will do it. Let's reconvene tomorrow,\" referring to Clifford's lawyer, Davidson. In the days and weeks that followed, the agreement almost unraveled after Cohen failed to transfer the money. He was then left scrambling to finalize the deal in late October. On the morning of Oct. 26, Cohen spoke with Trump twice over the phone. That same morning, Cohen set up a bank account for a shell company he had established earlier that month, Essential Consultants LLC, and transferred funds into the account from a home equity line of credit that he had open at the same bank. The following day, Cohen transferred $130,000 to Clifford, care of Davidson, to buy her silence about her alleged extramarital affair with Trump. Trump then repaid Cohen via a series of checks drawn from accounts he controlled or that were controlled by his business; Cohen revealed copies of some of the checks to Congress in March. AMI, meanwhile, also has admitted arranging a separate payment to McDougal in a so-called \"catch-and-kill\" arrangement to keep her quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump. End to the investigation? Another document unsealed on Thursday was a July 15, 2019, letter to Judge Pauley from prosecutors. They write that they have \"effectively concluded\" their investigations into whether anyone besides Cohen may also be criminally liable for the campaign finance violations, as well as whether certain individuals lied to investigators. After news broke Wednesday that the probe had ended, Trump's personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement that \"we have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation.\" On Thursday, Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, responded with a statement of his own. \"I challenge Jay Sekulow, who issued a misleading and false statement to answer the following two questions: Is it not a fact that SDNY prosecutors found President Trump to have 'directly and coordinated' the commission of a felony involving campaign finance federal laws? Is it not also a fact that upon his loss of purported immunity as president of the United States, he is subject to arrest, incarceration and a trial?\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller testified during a Senate hearing in 2013. Lawmakers are studying old film to prepare for his hearings scheduled for next week. Updated at 12:45 p.m. ET Members of Congress likely won't confine themselves to former special counsel Robert Mueller's report when they question him next week in two open hearings, staffers said. Mueller, who is reluctant to appear, has said he would confine himself to what he's already written \u2014 but the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence won't. \"I would expect us to ask some questions that would require answers that are not necessarily in the four corners of the report,\" an intelligence committee staffer said. \"We do not expect him to violate any policies, laws or regulations. But there is no policy, law or regulation that says he cannot go beyond ... a report that he selectively wrote. There were obviously parts of the investigation that were not included ... so there's no reason why he can't discuss his investigation.\" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told reporters on Friday that he expected Mueller to stick by what he's said. \"He indicated his report was his testimony. It would be reasonable to assume that he meant what he said, but we'll see.\" The intelligence committee aides said they will focus on highlighting interactions between President Trump's campaign, WikiLeaks, and Russia. The special counsel's office documented an extensive number of contacts but did not establish a criminal conspiracy. Lawmakers on this panel would focus more on the evidence than on the legal conclusions that Mueller ultimately drew, aides said. Staff members on the intelligence and judiciary committees briefed reporters about their preparations for the hearings on the condition they not be identified. The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, is expected to note that Mueller's stated belief that his report is the testimony, but members will try to find ways to draw new insight by staying within the document. Democrats on the committee don't expect some \"big dramatic revelation,\" a Judiciary Committee aide said, but instead to \"have dots connected.\" Democrats want Americans to see and hear Mueller tell his story on TV in a bid to reach more people than have likely read his more than 400-page phone book of a report. Aides want the story to be told about the actions taken by President Trump and how the Justice Department's treatment of him differs from how they would treat any other individual. \"Any other American who did these things would be criminally charged,\" added another Judiciary Committee aide. \"We want every American to understand that you have a president who has committed the most serious kinds of offenses possible.\" Republicans, meanwhile, also are likely to seize the opportunity to try to induce Mueller to repeat stories embarrassing for the FBI or Justice Department. Trump supporters have spent months attacking federal law enforcement and Mueller personally. Committees divide questioning The two panels have divided the types of questions they'll ask. The House Judiciary Committee plans to focus on Volume II of the Mueller Report, which lays out the evidence for alleged obstruction of justice by the president. Judiciary Committee staff members said that they would highlight five or six specific incidents of possible obstruction of justice: \u2014 The president's direction to then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. \u2014 The president's direction to McGahn to deny that he ordered McGahn to fire Mueller \u2014 The president's direction to former campaign staffer Corey Lewandowski to deliver a message to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the investigation. \u2014 The president's direction to Lewandowski asking him to fire Sessions if he refused to comply. \u2014 The president's alleged witness tampering with regard to Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. Democrats also plan to draw attention to former White House counsel McGahn. \"Mr. McGahn is very much on our mind, as you'll see next week,\" said a Judiciary Committee aide. \"McGahn is the most frequently discussed, and the most important witness, from the perspective of the Judiciary Committee.\" The intelligence panel will focus on Volume I, which lays out Russian interference and the Russian government's links to the Trump campaign. \"What Volume I actually shows is that Russia did engage in a shocking attack on our democracy,\" said an intelligence committee aide. \"But even more so, that instead of going to law enforcement, the Trump campaign ... instead welcomed it, welcomed the help, and used the help, and even went so far as to build some of their campaign messaging around Russia's assistance.\" Aides said members of Congress would be careful to ask Mueller questions \u2014 as opposed to using their time to make statements \u2014 and aides from both committees said they have carefully studied the former special counsel's previous congressional appearances. They expect a lot of \"yes\" and \"no\" answers. \"He never gives a 10-word answer when a one-word answer will do ... so we're taking that into account as we prepare how to best elicit answers from him,\" a Judiciary Committee aide said. \"Part of our preparation is connecting the dots with a witness who does not want to be in this hearing in particular ... he does not volunteer information easily.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

FaceApp hide caption The viral face-transforming FaceApp climbed to the top of the App Store on Wednesday. The growing popularity of FaceApp \u2014 a photo filter app that delights smartphone users with its ability to transform the features of any face, like tacking on years of wrinkles \u2014 has prompted Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer to call for a federal investigation into the Russia-based company over what he says are potential national security and privacy risks to millions of Americans. \"It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of U.S. citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,\" Schumer said in a letter to the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission. \"I ask that the FTC consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the privacy of Americans using this application, including government personnel and military service members, from being compromised,\" the senator wrote. BIG: Share if you used #FaceApp:The @FBI & @FTC must look into the national security & privacy risks nowBecause millions of Americans have used itIt\u2019s owned by a Russia-based companyAnd users are required to provide full, irrevocable access to their personal photos & data pic.twitter.com/cejLLwBQcr Even as privacy advocates raised security concerns, FaceApp's mug-morphing powers lured celebrities \u2014 or anyone who had their picture saved to their phone \u2014 such as Drake and the Jonas Brothers, to try on graying hair and wrinkles. By Wednesday, FaceApp had topped Apple's and Google's app download charts. Schumer's appeal echoed concerns expressed earlier in the day from the Democratic National Committee, over fears that its artificial intelligence technology could expose vulnerable facial recognition data to a country that launched a hacking campaign against the party during the 2016 election. The DNC has since expanded its cybersecurity efforts, including bringing on chief security officer Bob Lord. In an email sent to 2020 presidential campaign staff Wednesday, Lord urged \"people in the Democratic ecosystem\" against using an app that could have access to its users' photos. \"It's not clear at this point what the privacy risks are, but what is clear is that the benefits of avoiding the app outweigh the risks,\" Lord said in a notice first reported by CNN. \"If you or any of your staff have already used the app, we recommend that they delete the app immediately.\" Prior to the Democratic warnings, FaceApp began responding to a flood of inquiries about whether the company stores user data and where. FaceApp told TechCrunch in a statement that while its research and development team is based in Russia, no user data are transferred there. The company that created FaceApp, known as \"Wireless Labs,\" also claims that \"most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.\" Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told the website that FaceApp, headquartered in St. Petersburg, uses Amazon's cloud platform and Google Cloud to host the app data, where it processes \"most\" photos. Uploaded photos, FaceApp said, may be stored temporarily for \"performance and traffic\" to ensure users don't repeatedly upload the same photo as the platform completes an edit. Users have expressed concerns that the app has access to their entire respective iOS or Android photo library even if the user sets photo permissions to \"never.\" But FaceApp told TechCrunch that it only processes photos selected by the user \u2014 slurped from their photo library or those captured within the app. Security researchers have done their own work to back that claim. Will Strafach, a security researcher, said he couldn't find evidence that the app uploads the camera roll to remote servers. FaceApp also said that 99% of users don't log in and, for that group of users, it doesn't have access to any identifying data. Many data privacy experts are wary about these kinds of machine-learning apps, especially in a post-Cambridge Analytica era. Last year, Facebook said up to 87 million of its users' personal information was compromised by the third-party data analytics firm after an apparent breach of Facebook's policy. FaceApp's terms of service state that it won't \"rent or sell your information to third-parties outside FaceApp (or the group of companies of which FaceApp is a part) without your consent.\" But it's that parenthetical clause \u2014 giving leeway to an open-ended, unidentified \"group of companies\" \u2014 that raises a red flag for Liz O'Sullivan, a technologist at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, and, she said, leaves the door open to another Cambridge Analytica-type scandal. \"My impression of it honestly was shock that so many people were, in this climate, so willing to upload their picture to a seemingly unknown server without really understanding what that data would go to feed,\" she said. \"For all we know, there could be a military application, there could be a police application,\" O'Sullivan said of FaceApp. In the event FaceApp sells its platform to another company, its privacy policy states, \"user content and any other information collected through the service\" are also up for grabs. This app is one of many that leave open the potential to advance facial recognition software that, often unknown to users, is created from a compilation of people's faces. In many cases, O'Sullivan said, the public doesn't find out what information is being collected about them until we see personal data revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests. This month, as NPR has reported, researchers received records through one such request to find that Immigration and Customs Enforcement mines a massive database of driver's license photos in facial recognition efforts that may be used to target undocumented immigrants. Researchers have concluded facial recognition technology is biased and imperfect, putting innocent people at risk. O'Sullivan wants to see more regulation in place that's designed to protect consumers. Like her, many security advocates in the U.S. will be watching Europe's testing ground as lawsuits against tech giants play out under the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the European Union's sweeping new data privacy law.

Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption A wall titled \"Who's The Next To Drop Out?\" with faces of the Democratic candidates running for president in the 2020 election is displayed during the Netroots Nation conference at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia on Saturday. Justin Krebs, a campaign director with MoveOn, isn't interested in hearing pundits debate which 2020 Democratic candidate is the most \"electable.\" \"Because exactly four years ago right now there was a messy, crowded primary, with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable, and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning,\" he pointed out. And in the same vein, many Democrats thought Barack Obama was unelectable until he started winning primaries in 2008. Progressives say this word \"electability\" is being used as a fear tactic to intimidate voters into choosing a moderate, centrist nominee, specifically, former Vice President Joe Biden. But many of the activists who gathered over the weekend at the Netroots Nation conference insisted that's a foolish strategy. Biden, who has consistently led in early polling, is potentially the worst option for the party, they say, warning that Democrats could repeat the mistakes of 2016. Their main criticism of Biden is two-fold: He's too moderate on economic policy and has a complicated record on criminal justice and race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum. Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Netroots Nation candidate forum. There isn't unanimous agreement among progressive activists about who they want as a nominee. Some remain deeply loyal to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his role in pushing the party leftward. Others say they like the policy plans that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been rolling out. And yet others say they like what California Sen. Kamala Harris represents \u2014 a black woman who could take on President Trump. But where activists agree is on Biden \u2014 they would prefer almost any other 2020 Democrat over him. While they are purists in many ways, if Biden were to become the nominee, activists at Netroots said, they would vote for him, perhaps begrudgingly. Their fear is that others will not. Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration. Natalie Piserchio for NPR hide caption Maria Urbina, the national political director of Indivisible, says Democrats who ignore the demands of progressives are being dismissive of people who have been organizing and fighting against the Trump administration. \"We need to be able to build a coalition of voters that are excited, that are gonna turn out at historic levels, and we can't rely on it just being based on Trump being on the ballot; that won't be enough,\" said Maria Urbina, national political director for Indivisible. She didn't single Biden out by name, but she said whoever the nominee is, he or she has to energize the Democratic base, specifically young voters and minorities. Activists also point out that Republicans under a Trump administration have not toned down their rhetoric; why, they ask, should Democrats moderate their message? Many say that Hillary Clinton tried that strategy in 2016, and it clearly failed. They still ponder \u2014 maybe, if Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had been the nominee, the Democrats could have won the White House. Allegra Dengler, a Democratic activist from Westchester County, N.Y., one of nearly 4,000 activists who attended Netroots Nation, says people including her own son didn't like Clinton. They were looking for a change-maker.

Biden doesn't seem like a change-maker to her, either. \"We need to go to the future,\" she says. \"Why is he so popular? I have no idea. He's like a corporate Democrat from Delaware, which is like the corporate headquarters of everything.\" Activists say the party needs an inspirational candidate, and moderation doesn't inspire people.

But one candidate who has not is Joe Biden. On Monday, he unveiled a health care plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid and creating a more robust public option. It was a clear contrast to the more progressive alternative. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that,\" Biden said in a video. He warned that overhauling the system would be too risky. The fight over health care is a proxy for the broader ideological battle in the Democratic Party with Sanders on one end and Biden on the other.

Sanders has long championed a Medicare for All system. And he plans to deliver a speech on Wednesday to \"confront the opponents of Medicare for All.\" Sanders' supporters feel that Biden's approach is too incremental and antiquated. The goal, progressives say, is not merely to maintain the ACA, but to establish universal health care. But that's not the goal of most voters, who are more concerned about the cost of health care than the system itself, says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president of social policy and politics at the centrist think tank Third Way. \"It gives a huge window for Donald Trump and Republicans to label Democrats as socialists and have that label stick,\" said Erickson, who's skeptical of how progressives are framing the debate. Democrats, she says, have a clear road map to the White House in 2020 \u2014 they need to follow what they did in the 2018 midterms. \"The margin for taking back the House came from people who switched their votes, not people who stayed home, so if we are going to win again and beat Donald Trump, we absolutely need to win some folks who are coming over from the other side,\" Erickson said.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption Attorney General William Barr speaks as he stands with President Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during an event about the census in the Rose Garden at the White House earlier this month. The House of Representatives escalated its confrontation with the executive branch Wednesday by holding two Trump administration officials in criminal contempt for not providing complete copies of subpoenaed documents related to the 2020 census. The resolution named Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for failing to cooperate with a congressional oversight investigation. In a deeply divided House, Wednesday's criminal contempt measure passed on a mostly party-line vote of 230-198. The House's lone independent, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, backed the measure. Four Democrats broke with their leaders and opposed it. The rebuke of Trump Cabinet officials comes just a day after the House passed another resolution condemning the president himself for racist tweets over the weekend. The move marks the second time a sitting attorney general has been found in criminal contempt by the House. The first time was back in 2012, when the House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over his failure to turn over documents for the chamber's \"Fast and Furious\" probe. Seventeen Democrats joined with what was then a Republican majority to secure that outcome. In a sign of how long these actions can take, the House and Justice Department engaged in a legal battle that took seven years to resolve \u2014 and without any criminal penalty for Holder. Shortly before the vote, Barr and Ross sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her to postpone the House action and arguing their departments had made efforts to cooperate with the committee. They also said some of the materials requested were withheld because of the president's decision to assert executive privilege. \"By this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own integrity,\" they wrote. Wednesday's vote was a largely symbolic gesture; it's unlikely that the Department of Justice would move to prosecute the attorney general. The House had previously threatened to pursue a vote on civil contempt against Barr but backed off after the Justice Department made some concessions. But the symbolism represents a substantial escalation: These would be the first criminal contempt citations passed since Democrats took control of the House in January. The secretary dismissed the vote as \"just more political theater\" and noted that his department had handed thousands of pages of documents over to the committee already. \"We are not stonewalling. But we are also not yielding on the very, very important matter of executive privilege ... we are not going to be frightened into changing that position just because of some action the House might take,\" Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, told Fox Business on Wednesday morning. House Democrats had demanded information about why the administration sought to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and were not satisfied with the response, saying that neither Barr nor Ross responded to a legitimate congressional subpoena. The Trump administration had earlier told Democrats that it was asserting executive privilege over the requested documents about addition of a citizenship question. Democrats on the House oversight committee say they need these documents as part of their probe into the origins of the citizenship question among Trump administration officials. Democrats have been feuding with the Trump administration over the citizenship question since it was announced last year that the federal government was seeking to add it to the 2020 census. In recent days, following a Supreme Court decision that stalled the administration's efforts, President Trump announced that he's no longer pushing for the question to be included in the census. Shortly after, administration officials were formally accused of improperly covering up the question's origins. Commerce and Justice department officials \"obscured evidence suggesting that the true purpose of Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census \u2014 suppressing the political power of minority immigrant communities,\" alleged lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups challenging the question in court.

Sait Serkan Gurbuz/AP hide caption Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife, Nydia Stone, left federal court in Washington, Tuesday, July 16, 2019. A federal judge on Tuesday barred President Trump's longtime informal adviser, Roger Stone, from posting on Instagram or other social media platforms through the end of his trial. Judge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that Stone had violated an earlier gag order with a series of social media posts and media contacts over the past several months. \"Mr. Stone, what am I supposed to do with you?\" Jackson said during a more than two-hour hearing. \"Whether the problem is you can't follow simple orders or won't, I need to help you out.\" The answer, Jackson said, is to expand the previous conditions of release and the gag order that barred Stone from discussing his case or its participants in public or online. Stone has pleaded not guilty to obstruction, false statements and witness tampering, and is scheduled to go on trial in November. The case against him was brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller's office, but is now being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. At Tuesday's hearing, Jackson summarized the history of the restrictions she has placed on Stone and the lawyers in the case. She noted that Stone's attorneys have not raised any First Amendment or other objections to the gag order she imposed in February. The order, she said Tuesday, is \"clear as day.\" Over the course of an hour, Jackson went through a long list of instances in which Stone allegedly violated the court's gag order with posts on social media posts or contacts with the media. Those include a statement to BuzzFeed alleging that some of Michael Cohen's congressional testimony was a lie. They also included a series of posts on Stone's Instagram account, including one related to public filings in his case and another criticizing the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California. The criminal charges against Stone relate to his testimony before that committee, which was investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The defense: It was mostly just reposts Stone's attorney, Bruce Rogow, argued that none of the examples put forward by the government violate the court's order that Stone not discuss the case or its participants publicly. Many of the posts, Rogow said, amount to nothing more than Stone reposting someone else's statement. \"It's not a Roger Stone statement,\" he said. \"He's republishing it.\" Jackson pushed back. \"Isn't that how Instagram and Twitter work?\" she said. \"That's the power of it, the speed of it, the multiplication of it.\" Rogow pivoted to the question of whether the posts could taint the jury pool, which he said was the reason the gag order was imposed in the first place. \"None of these are the kind of things that have any reasonable basis to believe it will infect a fair trial,\" he said, arguing that none of Stone's Instagram posts got much traction online. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis disagreed. \"We believe the most recent posts clearly demonstrate a present risk to a fair trial and demonstrated that he's not able to follow the [gag] order,\" Kravis said. Asked by Jackson what he would recommend she do, Kravis said he thought the judge should at a minimum clarify the previous gag order. He also suggested prohibiting Stone from using social media completely. The government did not, however, recommend that Stone be jailed pending trial. Ultimately, Jackson ruled that Stone's posts had indeed violated her gag order. \"To suggest the posts aren't statements about the case ignores the power of social media,\" Jackson said. \"Maybe his lawyers don't understand it, but he does.\" The obvious purpose behind Stone's use of social media, she said, \"is to gin up more public comment and controversy about the legitimacy of the Mueller investigation, the House investigation, to get people to question the legitimacy of this prosecution.\" In the end, Jackson barred Stone from using Instagram, Facebook and Twitter through the end of his trial. His behavior so far, she said, has \"more to do with middle school than with a court of law.\" His ban from social media includes no forwarding, re-posting, retweeting or liking. All of the previous restrictions barring him from publicly discussing the case still remain in place. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

The public servant who led Iowa's Department of Human Services was forced to resign in June, just one business day after he sent an email to more than 4,000 agency employees that included an inspirational quote from the rapper Tupac Shakur. He used his love of rap from time to time to \"reach out to our staff, tell them that I'm human, have a little levity,\" he tells NPR. Foxhoven regularly held \"Tupac Fridays\" in his office, where the rapper's music was played \u2014 the lawyer said he liked breaking stereotypes about who listens to rap. Jerry Foxhoven, the former head of Iowa's Department of Human Services, who was abruptly removed from that position in June. Courtesy of Jerry Foxhoven hide caption \"I'm a 66-year-old white guy from the Midwest who likes rap music, who likes Tupac!\" he says. In fact, Foxhoven is a Tupac superfan. The civil servant is utterly dedicated to the slain rapper, celebrating his birthday with Tupac-themed baked goods; marking Tupac milestones (\"I might seem a little down because today is the 22nd anniversary of 2Pac's death,\" he wrote once to a staff member); and assigning Tupac as mandatory reading for his ethics class at Drake University. But Foxhoven's tenure at the Department of Human Services ended without warning \u2014 and without a chance for an orderly transition. After his email citing the rapper, Foxhoven was asked to resign. He says that he was not even granted a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. Instead, the governor's chief of staff confiscated his cell phone and ID card on the spot and ordered him not to go back to his office. They did not cite a reason, and Foxhoven was not made aware of why he was let go after two years on the job. Foxhoven was aware that at least one individual was not a fan of his Tupac quotations. In an email, one of his staff members alluded to the existence of a disgruntled employee, who then reported his Tupac references to state legislators. These emails indicate that action may have been taken due to his Tupac-related messages. \"I am going to hang in there on him \u2014 despite all the naysayers,\" he wrote in one email, after a staff member said that there were \"haters\" who didn't appreciate his Tupac quotes. Although he knew one employee had complained about his frequent references to Tupac, Foxhoven says he hopes they were not the reason he was forced to resign. He does wonder, however. Foxhoven points out that Barry Manilow's birthday is one day after Tupac's, and wonders whether he have been dismissed if he had cited Manilow instead.

But according to the Associated Press, the governor's office would not confirm or deny that Foxhoven's rap references were part of the reason for Foxhoven's dismissal. \"She wanted to go in a new direction,\" the governor's spokesman previously said in a statement, according to Iowa Public Radio. The spokesman provided no specifics. NPR made a public records request in order to obtain emails involving Foxhoven and his references to Tupac. Foxhoven's Tupac emails were first reported by the AP. The email which preceded his ouster was a positive one, in which he recognized Father's Day, Tupac's Birthday and his own work anniversary. \"Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back,\" he wrote, citing Tupac. \"It simply means that you are 2 steps ahead.\" In that same email, he praised his staff, writing that it was \"absolute honor to lead such a dedicated and committed group of people.\" In response, more than a dozen employees at the agency wrote back to praise him for the positive message. \"You are such a breath of fresh air, Jerry!\" wrote one staff member in response, according to emails obtained by NPR. The hundreds of pages of emails reviewed by NPR show that by all accounts Foxhoven was widely admired by his staff and regularly took time to mentor subordinates. In one email he dispensed career advice, noting that he was inspired at the agency by the well-known Tupac song \"Changes.\" Tupac-themed baked goods, brought to the office by staff to celebrate Mr. Foxhoven's birthday NPR hide caption In fact, he regularly cited Tupac in staff and agency-wide emails \u2014 including a Valentine's Day email in which he marveled, \"isn't it wonderful that we have a day to celebrate love?\" This observation was followed by a quote from Tupac's \"Dear Mama.\" The 66 year old's inbox even included a meme that referenced Tupac's famous collaboration with Dr. Dre, \"California Love.\" Ultimately, Foxhoven tells NPR he's glad that his emails about his favorite musical artist have now made national news, because it allows for a discussion about stereotypes and music. He said he was especially disturbed by a recent news story which reported that a 17-year-old boy in Arizona was fatally stabbed by a man who said the victim's rap music made him feel \"unsafe.\" \"It's important for us to break down those stereotypes: if you listen to rap music, you're a criminal or dangerous. It's not true at all,\" he says, adding that he hoped his situation could lead to \"having open discussions about race and what we have in common, instead of what separates us.\" He first got into Tupac in the early '90s when the rapper was still alive \u2014 \"we're going to have to get into this East Coast, West Coast thing,\" he says apologetically, as he explained his preference for the Californian musician. \"Part of the reason I like Tupac [is that] it's good music \u2014 it's not just rap with a bass in the background. It's fun to listen to, and also I liked over his career, you could see him transform.\" Foxhoven turns 67 next week, and is still figuring out what to do next. He wouldn't mind seeing the Tupac hologram in person, he says. One thing is for sure: \"I will be listening to some Tupac on my birthday.

Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a late entry to the 2020 race, hopes his red-state credentials will help him connect with voters. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock entered the Democratic primary in May, months after many of his competitors. He has an excuse. \"I had a job to do,\" Bullock told NPR, explaining that the Montana Legislature, which only meets for up to 90 days every other year, was in session until the end of April. \"If I had to choose between saving health care for 400,000 folks or chasing 100,000 donors? Easiest decision I'd ever make.\" But now he's in. The two-term governor and chair of the National Governors Association touts his credentials as the only candidate to win in 2016 in a state that President Trump also won. He has raised about $2 million and may qualify for the upcoming July debates after missing June's. Central to Bullock's campaign is the promise to do away with \"dark money\" \u2014 political money that can't be traced to its source. Before he was elected governor, Bullock served as Montana's attorney general and challenged the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Bullock told NPR's Noel King that on Day 1 he would sign an executive order mandating campaign spending disclosures from federal contractors. \"Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference,\" he said. On why he chose to center his campaign on dark money You could walk down the street, and people don't care necessarily about the money in the system, but they do care that Washington, D.C., doesn't work for them. I mean, we pay more for prescription drugs than any country in the world. We have nothing to show for it ... Whoever cleans this studio tonight will pay more [in taxes] than 60 of the Fortune 500 companies. So if the system is rigged because of the influence of money, that's when folks turn around and say, \"This economy is not working for me, the political system is not working for me\" \u2014 so let's just blow up the system. I've never in 10 years of public office had somebody come up to me and say, \"Oh! There's not enough spending in our elections.\" On his plan to limit dark money contributions Day 1, I'd sign an executive order that says if you want to contract with the federal government \u2014 I can't tell you that you can't spend or donate, but you have to disclose every single dollar that you are either spending or donating to influence our elections. Think about it. The federal government contracts with dang near every company in the country. Adding that sunshine and transparency will make a difference. On breaking gridlock and reaching rural voters Look, I'm not naive about the challenge, but certainly I tried to build relationships with Republican legislators in my statehouse. But I don't rely on those relationships alone. I go out all across our state. When we got Medicaid expansion through, I probably did 20 community meetings in rural Republican areas that were at risk of losing their hospital. So I think that the next president has to make their case, not just in Washington D.C., but to America. So I'd spend as much time in Kentucky as I am here because if you actually get voters saying, \"We expect more of our elected officials,\" that's how I think things get moved. On reversing his position on assault weapons We had a March for our Lives in Helena, in Montana. ... I went with my children. And I listened. And as these kids are saying enough, too, that's where I finally said enough with the assault weapons, because I know as a gun owner \u2014 and 40% of households in America have firearms in them \u2014 I know it's not for hunting. I know it's not for self-defense. Even industry is stopping this. When I was growing up the National Rifle Association was gun safety and hunting organization. Now it's nothing more than to try to divide people. Taylor Haney and Eric McDaniel produced and edited this story for broadcast.

The House passed a resolution condemning his comments on Tuesday. Updated at 6:54 p.m. ET The House passed a resolution condemning President Trump's \"racist comments\" on Tuesday evening. The nonbinding resolution states that Trump's remarks directed at members of Congress \"have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" It goes on to declare that \"immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger\"; that the House is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression;\" and that it \"strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" The resolution is sponsored by Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., who is Polish-born. Some of the co-sponsors also were born abroad. The resolution comes in response to Trump's tweets, starting Sunday and continuing into the week, in which he said that a group of Democratic lawmakers, all women of color, should \"go back\" to countries of their ancestry and that they \"hate\" America. Trump continued his broadsides against the four Tuesday, tweeting, \"Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!\" The four Democrats are Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All but Omar were born in the United States. Omar is a naturalized citizen from Somalia. Trump's comments have been widely condemned by Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers. The vote on the resolution presented GOP lawmakers with the choice of going on the record against the president, who is popular within the party, or going along with his latest incendiary remarks. Four Republicans and one independent voted in favor of the resolution. Read the full text below and see the document in its original form here. RESOLUTION Condemning President Trump's racist comments directed at Members of Congress. Whereas the Founders conceived America as a haven of refuge for people fleeing from religious and political persecution, and Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison all emphasized that the Nation gained as it attracted new people in search of freedom and livelihood for their families; Whereas the Declaration of Independence defined America as a covenant based on equality, the unalienable Rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and government by the consent of the people; Whereas Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional convention, \"When foreigners after looking about for some other Country in which they can obtain more happiness, give a preference to ours, it is a proof of attachment which ought to excite our confidence and affection\"; Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \"Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists\"; Whereas immigration of people from all over the Earth has defined every stage of American history and propelled our social, economic, political, scientific, cultural, artistic, and technological progress as a people, and all Americans, except for the descendants of Native people and enslaved African-Americans, are immigrants or descendants of immigrants; Whereas the commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents; Whereas American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good; Whereas President John F. Kennedy, whose family came to the United States from Ireland, stated in his 1958 book \"A Nation of Immigrants\" that \"The contribution of immigrants can be seen in every aspect of our national life. We see it in religion, in politics, in business, in the arts, in education, even in athletics and entertainment. There is no part of our nation that has not been touched by our immigrant background. Everywhere immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life.\"; Whereas President Ronald Reagan in his last speech as President conveyed \"An observation about a country which I love\"; Whereas as President Reagan observed, the torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom and represents our heritage, the compact with our parents, our grandparents, and our ancestors, and it is the Statue of Liberty and its values that give us our great and special place in the world; Whereas other countries may seek to compete with us, but in one vital area, as \"a beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws the people of the world, no country on Earth comes close\"; Whereas it is the great life force of \"each generation of new Americans that guarantees that America's triumph shall continue unsurpassed\" through the 21st century and beyond and is part of the \"magical, intoxicating power of America\"; Whereas this is \"one of the most important sources of America's greatness: we lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people \u2014 our strength \u2014 from every country and every corner of the world, and by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation\"; Whereas \"thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we're a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge\", always leading the world to the next frontier; Whereas this openness is vital to our future as a Nation, and \"if we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost\"; and Whereas President Trump's racist comments have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color: Now, therefore, be it resolved, That the House of Representatives \u2014 (1) believes that immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger, and that those who take the oath of citizenship are every bit as American as those whose families have lived in the United States for many generations; (2) is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression, and those who are willing to work hard to live the American Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity, faith, or country of origin; and (3) condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should \"go back\" to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as \"invaders,\" and by saying that Members of Congress who are immigrants (or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America.

        "title": "John Paul Stevens, Retired Supreme Court Justice, Dies At 99 : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, a veteran of 34 years on the U.S. Supreme Court, has died. He was 99. Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford. And while he was once viewed as moderately conservative, he eventually earned a reputation as the most liberal justice on a court dramatically more conservative than the one he joined in 1975. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: John Paul Stevens, often called a judge's judge, was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, law and politics were a noble pursuit not a blood sport. The quintessential Midwesterner Stevens was born in Chicago, educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and, later, appeals court judge. In 1975, President Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. And Stevens, wearing his trademark bow tie, was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. Given his lack of political ties, Stevens' rise was, to some extent, a fluke, according to his onetime law clerk Clifford Sloan. CLIFFORD SLOAN: It was an accident of history, and the stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment. TOTENBERG: A brand-new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. And with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also picked for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism. Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work and for independence. Over time, he was seen as an increasingly respected and influential justice, a man beloved by his colleagues for his decency, his unassuming nature and his tough inner core. In his first decade, he was viewed as a center-right justice. But as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member - a moniker he never liked. Indeed, Stevens said forthrightly in 2010 that it wasn't he who changed. Rather, it was a court populated by new justices with a conservative ideology that Stevens saw as quite radical. Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to obscenity, from school prayer to campaign finance reform, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. TOTENBERG: As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED OLSON: The crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident. TOTENBERG: The decisions Stevens will likely be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-3 decision repudiating President Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004, he authored the court's 6-3 decision, allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. Stevens also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones; the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN PAUL STEVENS: In the entire history of the republic, only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. As for the case at hand, there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly after discovery is concluded. TOTENBERG: Critics thought Stevens' view naive - the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And, indeed, as it turned out, Paula Jones' case led directly to the impeachment of President Clinton. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system; that no person is above the law. While Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together, under one legal tent, justices one might not expect to agree, he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens, the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star, objected, declaring that the value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, when the court majority ruled that a key section of the Brady gun-control law unconstitutionally conscripted local law enforcement to conduct background checks on gun buyers, Stevens took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties. Since the ultimate issue is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency - matters such as the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic or, perhaps, the threat of an international terrorist. TOTENBERG: Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later, when he managed to eke out a 5-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program. TOTENBERG: Stevens' angriest dissent came, without doubt, in Bush v. Gore. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner in this year's presidential election, he wrote, the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law. Two other dissents were barn burners as well. His 2008 dissent, when a five-justice majority struck down a local ban on handguns, ruling for the first time that there's a constitutional right for individuals to own a gun - and his 2010 dissent, when the same five-justice majority struck down a century-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections. Stevens' oral dissent in the campaign finance case, provided here by the Oyez Project, was passionate and long. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVENS: Simply put, corporations are not human beings. In the context of an election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Corporations cannot vote or run for office. Because they're managed (ph) and controlled by non-residents, their interests may conflict in fundamental ways with the interests of eligible voters. The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporate speakers exactly like human beings in the political realm represents a radical change in the law. TOTENBERG: Behind the scenes, Stevens was often a persuasive and strategic thinker. In 1992, for instance, he played a pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. The court was split into three separate factions - four justices to reverse Roe outright, three to uphold its core but allow more regulation by the states and two, including Stevens and Harry Blackmun, to uphold Roe entirely. Upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun could join most of it, and there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority of 5. The three quickly agreed, and the opinion became the law of the land. In a 2010 NPR interview, Stevens said that in his three and a half decades on the court, he really had just one regret. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEVENS: I think there is one vote that I would change. And that's one - was upholding the Texas capital punishment statute. TOTENBERG: He cast that vote in 1976, at a time when, he noted, the court had adopted many rules to limit the death penalty to a narrow category of offenders and to prevent what he called loading the dice for the prosecution. But over time, those limiting rules were abandoned. And so in his later years, Stevens opposed most death sentences, winning rare but important victories, as when he wrote the court's opinion striking down capital punishment for the, quote, \"mentally retarded.\" He maintained he was undecided about retiring. But in late June of 2010, his lengthy dissent in the campaign finance case was marred by verbal flubs. He was so distressed by his performance that he sought a complete checkup by his doctor. There was nothing wrong. But not long thereafter, Stevens announced his retirement. In the years afterwards, he continued to be both physically and intellectually active, playing tennis and golf, writing articles and books and speaking about the court and its work. When he thought the court in error, he lobbed critiques, as always, pointed, literate and respectful. The very qualities that made him such a revered figure in the law. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. KELLY: And the news again for those of you just joining us - retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens died this evening at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The cause was complications following a stroke. And Nina Totenberg is here with us live. Hey there, Nina. TOTENBERG: Hi there, Mary Louise. KELLY: Hey. My main question for you, as somebody who's covered the court for so many years - tell me your best Justice Stevens story. How will you remember him? TOTENBERG: I will always remember him as such a gentleman, that when he would ask a question - and he asked very good questions - he would say something on the order of, excuse me, counsel. Forgive me. Maybe I'm not quite understanding you, but - and then he would ask this question that would go to the heart of the case. And the lawyer would be left standing there sort of gawking, going, what do I do with this? But he was never impolite. He was always kind. He really... KELLY: Yeah. TOTENBERG: ...Was a beloved figure. KELLY: Yeah. That is NPR's Nina Totenberg, remembering John Paul Stevens, who served 34 years on the U.S. Supreme Court. He died tonight. He was 99 years old.

President Trump has accused the \"squad\" of hating America and has said they should \"go back\" to where they came from. Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images hide caption From Right: U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar at a press conference at the Capitol on Monday. President Trump has accused the \"squad\" of hating America and has said they should \"go back\" to where they came from. President Trump is showing no signs of dialing back what Democrats are calling a \"blatantly racist attack\" on four members of Congress, who are all women of color. Trump is accusing the \"squad\" of \"radical Democrats\" of hating America and has said they should \"go back\" to where they came from. Three of the four congresswomen \u2014 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 were born in the U.S. The fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, became a U.S. citizen at age 12. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the use of the racist trope \"disgusting\" and vowed a resolution condemning the president's language, while Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, said Trump's xenophobic attack was new grounds for impeachment. Pressley, who is African American, blasted the president for \"the callous, chaotic and corrupt culture of this administration.\" The president seems more buoyed by the criticism than bothered, insisting that \"a lot of people love\" his Twitter attack on the progressive Democrats. But in the Massachusetts district where Pressley was elected, constituents are far more livid than loving it. Even those who support the job Trump's doing as president are rolling their eyes at his antics as they decide to look past them. \"He's racist, he's psychotic and he's destroying democracy,\" proclaimed D.L. Polonsky, who was wearing a \"Deport Trump\" button last night in Allston, a gritty neighborhood of Boston that Pressley represents. Polonsky, an anti-Trump political cartoonist, says he's deeply offended by the president's latest comments, but not surprised. He sees it as a deliberate political stunt meant to rally Trump's base. \"He's just trying to distract,\" he says. \"He's just gaslighting and he's just a disruptor.\" \"It was flat out racist. I don't think there's anything grey about it, and I'm horrified that he represents our country,\" echoes Deanna Byrne, a Democratic political activist who has worked for Pressley's campaign. As she sees it, Trump has hit a new low \u2014 yet again. \"It's dangerous because he's normalizing this,\" she says. \"And if the bar keeps moving in that direction, what's the situation going to be two more years from now?\" Sarah Leib, a bartender at Silhouette Lounge in Allston, Mass., believes Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, but he's jacking up resentment among white Americans. Tovia Smith/NPR hide caption Sarah Leib, a bartender at Silhouette Lounge in Allston, Mass., believes Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, but he's jacking up resentment among white Americans. Around the corner at a neighborhood dive called the Silhouette Lounge, bartender Sarah Leib says the damage is already apparent. Trump is not only dragging down the public discourse, she says, but he's also jacking up resentment among white Americans. She points to a recent incident when she refused to serve a man drinks because he was already drunk. \"He accused me of not serving him because he's a white male,\" she recalls. \"He made himself out to be the victim of a big conspiracy. I've never seen anything like that.\" Leib says Trump's comments were not only offensive, but also absurd. Members of Congress, she says, don't deserve to be attacked simply because they're being critical of policies. \"That's what they're supposed to do,\" she says. \"I mean, they're doing their job, and they're doing it effectively. But [Trump's] ego is so fragile that he says some asinine thing that [becomes] news.\" Ana Maria Arabanos, 23, who was sipping a drink at the bar, also takes offense at Trump's antics but sees a silver lining: The whole uproar is focusing positive attention on the \"squad\" \u2014 including her congresswoman, Pressley, she says. \"I'm grateful we do have leaders that are representative of me, like being a woman of color, who are standing up to Trump,\" she says. \"It's putting them in the spotlight.\" Another patron, 60-year-old Republican Chris Kennedy, who voted for Trump, sees a different upside. While he doesn't like the president's comments, he says he's happy that Trump is drawing attention to issues he cares about, like immigration policy. \"I think that as negative as he is, and as much as a troublemaker as he is,\" Kennedy says, \"[Trump] is contributing to a very positive forward momentum because politicians behind him will have no choice but to focus on these issues that he has pushed to the surface.\" Bill Rhodes, 54, in town on business from Connecticut, is also a Trump fan. But, he explains, that's only because he \"purposely\" doesn't even look at Trump's tweets. \"You can't let it bother you because, I mean, he says stupid stuff every week,\" he says. \"But as long as he's doing a good job, then that's good. I mean, my stock has soared, and you know, the economy's doing well.\" That is far more important, Rhodes says, than Trump's comments, which he considers more questionable than overtly racist. \"Unless [Trump] actually called them out on race, I don't think it's racist,\" he says. \"I mean, I've heard others say stuff like that too.\" Alan Walter, 65, says he's among those likely to make a comment like Trump's, and he loves that the president is proving he doesn't cow to political correctness. Walter points his disappointment instead at Democrats who he says are unfairly playing the race card. \"The racist thing is so burnt out, man,\" he sighs. \"It's such a sad, sad thing. It's such a lame label to throw [around], to just say, 'Oh he's a racist.' It's the easiest thing to do.\" But Walter also agrees with Trump critics on one thing: that the president's controversial comments are less a slip of the tongue than a deliberate strategy aimed at winning him a second term in office.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption From left, Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand faced off in the June 27 debate. All will be back for next week's rounds. The 20-person lineup for the two-night Democratic presidential debate on July 30 and 31 will look familiar, with just one change from last month's event. Last week, California Rep. Eric Swalwell became the first major candidate to end his White House bid. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2014 after only narrowly missing the mark last time \u2014 will take his place. The criteria for the second debate was the same as the first, requiring hopefuls to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate must have registered at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both requirements \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Loading... The remaining six candidates made the cut because of their standing in the polls, but did not meet the donor threshold \u2014 Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel qualified based on donations alone, but under the DNC formula, polling is given greater weight, thus he didn't make the cut. Ten candidates will be debating each night. Other major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just entered the race late last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who reversed his initial decision to pass on the race last week, also haven't qualified, with little time to register in polls or raise money. CNN, which is hosting this next series of debates in Detroit, will hold a live drawing on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET to determine which candidates will appear on which night. That's where the real shake-up will happen, shuffling which White House hopefuls get to face off against one another and which will have a chance to take aim at the top-tier candidates. In the first debate, Harris seized her chance against Biden in the second night of the debate. She went after him over his past opposition to mandated busing to integrate schools in the 1970s, and Biden faltered in his response. That helped her rise in many polls. On the first debate night, Castro found a chance to emerge from the pack after taking a firm stance on decriminalizing illegal border crossings and taking on fellow Texan O'Rourke's reluctance to back such a change. Castro saw his fundraising surge while O'Rourke has continued to struggle. The stakes of performing well in the July debate could be high for several candidates. The criteria for the third debate in September is expected to winnow the field further. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Scott Detrow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks about his \"Medicare for All\" proposal on Wednesday at George Washington University. Patrick Semansky/AP hide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks about his \"Medicare for All\" proposal on Wednesday at George Washington University. Hoping to regain momentum as two rival candidates creep closer in the polls, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders returned to his signature policy theme in a major speech Wednesday: a single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" health insurance system. \"The time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman, and child in this country,\" Sanders told supporters and reporters in Washington, D.C. Sanders outlined in broad strokes how he'd implement Medicare for All: He'd lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55 in the first year of the new program, then to 45, then 35, then eventually to every adult. Children, Sanders said, would be eligible for the insurance program in the first year of the transition. Sanders also said he also wants to expand Medicare beyond its current benefits to include dental coverage as well. \"The desire to have teeth in your mouth is a health care issue,\" he said. Sanders argues that universal, government-run health care would lower medical costs and eliminate insurance premiums, deductibles, and payments \u2014 but he also acknowledged his proposal would require tax increases. Sanders mocked the idea of families celebrating the status-quo insurance costs that he has pledged to eliminate. \"Oh my God, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day,\" he said. \"Oh wow, let's celebrate.\" The costs for a program like the one Sanders has outlined long have been a sticking point. Two years ago, California legislative analysts put the price tag of a potential single-payer health care system at $400 billion for California alone. The bill in question died in California's Assembly, which is overwhelmingly Democratic. Striving to stand out The speech comes at a time when Sanders is facing increasing pressure from other Democrats in the top tier of polling and fundraising: most notably, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris. While Sanders had long registered far above any other candidate but former Vice President Joe Biden, Harris and Warren have gained substantial ground in recent weeks. Warren has narrowly jumped past Sanders into second place, behind Biden, in a handful of surveys, and raised more money than Sanders from individual contributions in the last quarter. Sanders' campaign leaders say they're aware of the shifting dynamics but they're not panicking. \"I think it's more of the case that other people are gaining some attention and traction. They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them,\" said campaign manager Faiz Shakir. \"They're fresher to the scene for that reason, so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine.\" Still, Sanders has been reluctant to criticize Warren, Harris and other candidates who have embraced large planks from his progressive platform, even as he competes with them for support. \"Elizabeth [Warren] is a longtime friend of mine, she is a very good senator,\" Sanders recently told NPR. \"Elizabeth's running her campaign. I'm running my campaign.\" The hesitance is especially notable since Harris has repeatedly vacillated on her support for a core aspect of the Sanders Medicare for All plan she has co-sponsored in the Senate: the complete elimination of private health insurance, outside of supplementary plans. In a CNN interview this week, Harris said it would likely take more than four years to fully transition from the current health care system to Medicare for All. Harris also argued that preserving private health insurance ensures more coverage for more Americans without raising taxes on the middle class. Sanders has acknowledged his health care proposals would require higher taxes \u2014 but argues it would also lower medical bills and eliminated insurance costs, making the increase worth it. And while Warren laid out several detailed policy plans during the initial months of her presidential campaign, she too did not unequivocally back the full elimination of private health insurance until last month's debate. Instead of pointing out those inconsistencies to progressives who may be migrating to support for Harris and Warren, Sanders has focused his fire on Biden, attacking what Sanders rejects as a \"middle ground\" approach to politics. Biden's less radical outlook In the days since Biden unveiled a health care plan centered around the existing Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and creating a public option government insurance plan, Sanders and his campaign have gone as far as comparing Biden's view on health care to President Trump's. Earlier this week, Sanders' camp sent an email to reporters warning that an Obamacare-centered health insurance plan \"leaves nearly 10 million people uninsured,\" and \"leaves people at the whims of their employers.\" That's despite the fact that Sanders helped lead the effort to save the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and 2018, when Republican majorities in the House and Senate tried and failed to repeal Obamacare. \"The Affordable Care Act took us a step forward,\" Sanders told NPR in 2017, even as he advocated for an eventual shift to a single-payer system. \"It provided health insurance for over 20 million more Americans. That's no small thing. It did away with the obscenity of preexisting conditions and a number of other essential health care benefits that are now guaranteed to the American people. So it made some real change.\" For his part, Biden has framed Medicare for All as a \"risky\" elimination of an Affordable Care Act that he argues is already here and working. \"I knew Republicans would do everything in their power to repeal Obamacare. They still are. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it,\" Biden said in a campaign video posted this week. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All,\" Biden said. \"But folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump rephrased some racist remarks without changing the meaning. He said that four lawmakers should go back where they came from and then said if they don't like America, they can leave. The lawmakers, for the record, are Americans elected by Americans. And NPR's Tovia Smith visited the district of one, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: As President Trump was dismissing criticism of what he said, he was also insisting that, quote, \"a lot of people love it.\" But in deep blue Massachusetts, not so much. D L POLONSKY: He's racist. He's psychotic. He's destroying democracy. SMITH: D.L. Polonsky (ph) wears a \"Deport Trump\" button in Allston, a gritty neighborhood of Boston that's represented by African American Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. An anti-Trump political cartoonist, Polonsky says he's offended by the president's latest comments but not surprised. He sees it as a deliberate political stunt meant to rally Trump's base. POLONSKY: He's just trying to distract. He's just gaslighting. And he's just a disruptor. SMITH: Around the corner at a neighborhood bar, bartender Sarah Leib says Trump has hit a new low - again. He's dragging down the public discourse, she says, and jacking up resentment among white Americans. Take the guy the other night who she refused to serve because he was already drunk. SARAH LEIB: He's like, you won't serve me because I'm a white male. I'm like, dude, like - (laughter) there's - yeah, I've never seen anything like that. SMITH: Leib says Trump is completely unfair to attack any member of Congress for criticizing policies. LEIB: That's what they're supposed to do. I mean, they're doing their job, and they're doing it effectively. But his ego is so fragile and thin, he says some asinine thing, that now that's in the news. SMITH: On the upside, 23-year-old Ana Maria Arabanos says the whole uproar is focusing positive attention on the squad, including her Congresswoman, Ayanna Pressley. ANA MARIA ARABANOS: And I'm grateful that we do have leaders that are representative of me, like, being a woman of color, who are standing up to him. SMITH: Across the bar, 60-year-old Republican Chris Kennedy, who voted for Trump, sees a different upside. He doesn't like the president's comments, but he is happy that Trump is drawing attention to issues like immigration policy. CHRIS KENNEDY: I think as negative as he is and as much of a troublemaker as he is, he is contributing to a very positive forward momentum because politicians behind him will have no choice but to focus on these issues that he has pushed to the surface. SMITH: Fifty-four-year-old Bill Rhoades, who's in town on business from Connecticut, is also a Trump fan but only, he says, because he purposely does not follow Trump's tweets. BILL RHOADES: You can't let it bother you because, I mean, he says stupid stuff every week. But as long as he's doing a good job, then that's good. I mean, my stock has soared. The economy's doing well. SMITH: All that counts more, Rhoades says, than what he sees as Trump's questionable comments. RHOADES: Unless he's actually called them out on their race, I don't think it's racist. I mean, I've heard other people say stuff like that too. ALAN WALTER: That sounds like something I'd say too. SMITH: Sixty-five-year-old Alan Walter says he sees it as a plus that the president doesn't cow to political correctness. And he points his criticism at the Democrats, who he says are playing the race card. WALTER: You know, the racist thing is so burnt out, man. It's such a lame label. Just - oh, just say, oh, he's a racist. It's the easiest thing to do. SMITH: But Walter also agrees with Trump critics on one thing, that the president's controversial comments are less a slip of the tongue than a deliberate strategy he hopes will win him a second term in office.

Ilhan Omar, shown here at the Capitol on Thursday, has been a target of racist rhetoric from President Trump. Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the freshman Democratic congresswomen facing attacks from President Trump and his supporters, was cheered as she arrived back at her home district in Minnesota on Thursday. A crowd of people at the airport in the Twin Cities held banners with slogans such as \"Stop Racism Now\" and chanted \"welcome home Ilhan\" as the congresswoman emerged from her flight. \"We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president,\" she said into a megaphone, \"because his policies are a nightmare to us. We are not deterred, we are not frightened, we are ready.\" Watch the moment captured on video by Tom Hauser of KSTP-TV: Congresswoman Omar just arrived back in the Twin Cities. pic.twitter.com/ZiFqWnDJgQ Throughout this past week, Trump has targeted Omar and her fellow progressive congresswomen \u2014 New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 with repeated attacks. In a tweet on Sunday, he said the four women of color should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" And at a rally on Wednesday, Trump attacked each congresswoman individually. As he spoke about Omar, the crowd started to chant \"send her back,\" echoing the president's tweet. Omar, an American citizen, came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia when she was a child. Trump attempted to distance himself from the racist chant on Thursday, saying \"I wasn't happy with that message that they gave last night.\" \"It was quite a chant, and I felt a little bit badly about it. But I will say this, I did \u2014 and I started speaking very quickly. But it started up rather fast,\" the president added. However, as NPR's Tamara Keith noted, \"in reality, Trump stood there for 13 seconds as the chant continued, waiting for it to die down before he resumed his remarks.\" Omar traveled to the Twin Cities on Thursday to participate in a town hall to discuss \"Medicare for All,\" as CNN reported. \"I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to let them,\" Omar told the crowd. Earlier in the day, Omar told reporters in Washington, D.C., that she sees the president as a \"fascist\" and said she considered this fight about \"what this country truly should be,\" according to The Associated Press.

Zach Gibson/Getty Images hide caption President Trump gestures to the crowd during a Keep America Great rally in Greenville, N.C. on Wednesday. Updated at on July 18 at 1:52 p.m. ET President Trump continued his attacks against four freshman Democratic congresswomen at a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday, with the crowd breaking into a chant of \"send her back\" against one, echoing the president's racist message from the weekend. Trump on Thursday disavowed the chant. But Wednesday night, Trump piled on Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia as a child. Egged on by several false explosive claims against the Muslim congresswoman, Trump's supporters broke into the chant. It's the latest fanning of flames by Trump after he tweeted on Sunday that the four progressive members \u2014 Omar, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four are American citizens who are women of color, and all except Omar were born in the United States. Trump has repeatedly refused to apologize even as the House passed a measure condemning his remarks. Omar responded in a tweet on Wednesday night, quoting the late Maya Angelou by saying, in part, \"You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.\" You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.-Maya Angelou https://t.co/46jcXSXF0B Asked if the campaign would disavow the \"send her back\" chant, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement: \"The Squad, as they call themselves, are now the leaders of the Democrat Party. Americans don't like it when elected officials consistently disparage this country. All the Democrats are pushing socialist ideas that are terrible for America. They are all the same.\" Later in the afternoon on Thursday, a reporter asked Trump directly why he did not stop the chant. He said, \"I started speaking very quickly.\" Trump did not chastise the crowd at the rally and paused for several seconds while the chant was audible. \"I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,\" he said Thursday in the Oval Office. Crowd at tonight's Trump rally in North Carolina breaks out into chants of \"Send her back!\" as the president attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/0q5L39W61h During Wednesday night's rally, Trump ticked off his alleged grievances with each of the four women, painting them as taking anti-American stances. With Ocasio-Cortez, he said her name was too long to learn how to say and simply called her \"Cortez.\" \"They're always telling us how to run [the country]... you know, if they don't love it, tell 'em to leave it,\" Trump said. Community response to Trump's attacks While the Trump-friendly crowd may have cheered his doubling down on his racist remarks, that sentiment isn't shared throughout the greater city of Greenville and on the campus of East Carolina University, where Trump's rally was held. Trump narrowly won North Carolina, but he lost Pitt County, which is about a third African-American and about 6% Latino. Pastor Kenneth Hammond stands in the sanctuary at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville. Madeline Gray for NPR hide caption Pastor Kenneth Hammond stands in the sanctuary at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville. Kenneth Hammond is the interim pastor at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church, an African American community of worship which was burned to the ground by an arsonist in 1969. Hammond said Trump's language was unmistakable, and was a trope frequently used during the fight for civil rights. \"We as a people and we as a congregation have had firsthand experiences on how racist activities can impact people of faith... When you hear the rhetoric of going back from where you came from \u2014 for many of our folk, that's two blocks from here, so we are well invested in this country,\" Hammond said. \"The contributions that we've made to the success of this country are well-documented.\" Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Madeline Gray for NPR hide caption Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Trump has argued, and did again on Wednesday night, that Democrats are the ones using extremist language, but Hammond said that argument doesn't hold water. \"If it barks like a dog, it looks like a dog. It's a dog. And so it's it's it's racist is racist at its worst level,\" the pastor said. Even some of Trump's supporters in Greenville were dismayed by the tweets, such as Emma Arndt, chairwoman of the newly-formed College Republicans on East Carolina's campus. \"He had a moment. I think that he made a mistake but I think that he can build from it. And I think that he can maybe work on his initial tweets and stuff like that,\" said Arndt, who was at the rally registering voters. Trump delivers 2020 message Much of the rest of the rally was standard Trump fare, but there was a clear emphasis on women at the rally even as the president was on the attack against multiple Democratic women. Fresh off the launch of \"Women for Trump\" this week, signs with that slogan dotted the crowd. The president touted how well the economy was doing for women especially, and he hammered home the country's strong economic success overall \u2014 something most Republican strategists wish he would make more of his main emphasis instead of insults and stoking other controversies. As he usually does at rallies, Trump relived his unlikely 2016 election victory and condemned the \"witch hunt\" against him, even using profanity. This rally was originally scheduled to coincide with former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill, but that has now been delayed for one week. Trump did revel in the failed vote to move forward on articles of impeachment earlier today in the House, which was handily defeated by both Republicans and Democrats. \"That was a slaughter,\" Trump said, conceding that he did \"have to thank most of the Democrats\" for their votes. Many of the Democratic members who voted no want to go through a full process of investigations and hearings before voting.

Trump did turn his attention toward some of his potential 2020 rivals. He mocked former Vice President Joe Biden's lackluster debate performance last month, reviving his nickname of \"Sleepy Joe.\" Trump reveled in Biden's polling slide after California Sen. Kamala Harris's attack against him in last month's first debate about his past opposition to mandated busing in the 1970s. Trump did note that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who he again referred to as \"Pocahontas\" was rising. And he also mocked the pronunciation of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg's name and said he was unprepared to be president.

Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, then 91, works in his office at the Supreme Court on Sept. 28, 2011. Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, whose Supreme Court opinions transformed many areas of American law during his 34 year tenure, died at the age of 99 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., of complications following a stroke he suffered Monday. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed Stevens' death in a statement from the Supreme Court. \"A son of the Midwest heartland and a veteran of World War II, Justice Stevens devoted his long life to public service, including 35 years on the Supreme Court,\" Roberts said in the statement. \"He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Elizabeth and Susan, and to his extended family.\" The court's statement noted that \"he passed away peacefully with his daughters by his side.\" Often called a judge's judge, Stevens was something of a throwback to a less rancorous era, when, as one writer put it, law and politics were a noble pursuit, not a blood sport. The quintessential Midwesterner, Stevens was born in Chicago and educated at Northwestern and the University of Chicago. In the Windy City, he earned a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and later appeals court judge. In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination drew instant praise from Democrats and Republicans alike, and Stevens, wearing his trademark bow tie, was confirmed in a remarkable three weeks. 'Accident of history' Given his lack of political ties, Stevens' rise was, to some extent, a fluke according to his onetime law clerk, Clifford Sloan. \"It was an accident of history,\" Sloan said, adding, \"The stars lined up in a way that could not have been possible before that precise moment, and probably could not have been possible after that precise moment.\" A brand new president, Gerald Ford, suddenly had a Supreme Court vacancy to fill, and with the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, the name of the game was to pick someone of unassailable credentials and no political connections. Ford assigned his attorney general, Edward Levi, a man also chosen for his lack of political ties, to do the screening. And Levi, the onetime dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quickly fixed his eye on Stevens, a lifelong Republican with no record of political or judicial activism. John Paul Stevens, then 55, talks to reporters in Chicago on Nov. 28, 1975, after being nominated by President Gerald Ford to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fred Jewell/AP hide caption Once on the court, Stevens quickly earned a reputation for quality work, and for independence. Over time he was seen as an increasingly respected and influential justice, a man beloved by his colleagues for his decency, his unassuming nature, and his tough inner core. In his first decade, he was viewed as a center-right justice, but as the composition of the court grew more and more conservative, he found himself referred to as the court's most liberal member, a moniker he never liked. Indeed, Stevens said forthrightly in a 2010 interview with NPR that it wasn't he who changed. Rather, it was a court populated by new justices with a conservative ideology that he saw as quite radical. 'Crafty and genial hand' Over the years, Stevens authored some 400 majority opinions for the court on almost every issue imaginable, from property rights to immigration, from abortion to obscenity, from school prayer to campaign-finance reform, from term limits to the relationship between the federal and state governments. As former Solicitor General Ted Olson put it: \"The crafty and genial hand of Justice Stevens was everywhere evident.\" The decisions Stevens will likely be remembered for most, though, are those he authored on national security and presidential power. Stevens wrote the court's 5-to-3 decision repudiating president George W. Bush's assertion of unilateral executive power in setting up war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 2004 he authored the court's 6-to-3 decision allowing the Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detentions in the U.S. courts. Both had profound implications for the limits of presidential power. Bush was not the first president to feel Stevens' sting. He also wrote the opinion for a unanimous court in Clinton v. Jones, the decision refusing to postpone Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Bill Clinton. In summarizing the decision from the bench in 1997, Stevens dismissed the notion that the suit would burden the presidency. \"In the entire history of the republic,\" he said, \"only three sitting presidents have been subjected to suits for their private actions. As for the case at hand ... there's nothing in the record to identify any potential harm that might ensue from scheduling the trial promptly.\" Critics thought Stevens' view na\u00efve \u2014 the view of a man who knew nothing of the venality of politics or political enemies. And, indeed, as it turned out, the Paula Jones case led directly to Clinton's impeachment. But defenders of the decision see it as an example of the highest value in the American legal system \u2014 that no person is above the law. A dissenting voice While Stevens authored some of the court's most complex and important decisions, often bringing together under one legal tent justices one might not expect to agree, he also dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice during his long tenure on the bench. When the court struck down a Texas law that punished burning the American flag, Stevens \u2014 the Navy veteran and winner of the Bronze Star \u2014 objected, declaring that \"the value of the of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured.\" When the court revived the doctrine of states' rights, he dissented. In 1997, when the court majority ruled that a key section of the Brady gun-control law unconstitutionally conscripted local law enforcement to conduct background checks of gun buyers, Stevens took the unusual step of announcing his dissent from the bench. \"The basic question is whether Congress, acting on behalf of the people of the entire nation, has the power to require local law enforcement officers to perform certain duties,\" he said. \"Since the ultimate question is one of power, we have to consider its implications in times of national emergency, matters such as ... the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or perhaps the threat of an international terrorist.\" Justice John Paul Stevens, a Chicago native, throws out the first pitch before the Chicago Cubs game Sept. 14, 2005, at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Jeff Roberson/AP hide caption Stevens' ultimate revenge came eight years later when he managed to eke out a 5-to-4 majority upholding a federal regulatory scheme under which the federal law making marijuana illegal trumped state laws legalizing it for medical purposes. \"Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program,\" he said. Bush v. Gore Stevens' angriest dissent came, without doubt, in 2000, in the case of Bush v. Gore, which effectively ended the presidential race in favor of George W. Bush. \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election,\" he wrote, \"the identity of the loser is clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as impartial guardian of the rule of law.\" Two other dissents were barn burners, too. His 2008 dissent, when a five-justice majority struck down a local ban on handguns, ruling for the first time that there is a constitutional right for individuals to own a gun. And his 2010 dissent, when the same five-justice majority struck down a century-old ban on corporate spending in candidate elections. Stevens dissent from the bench in that case \u2013 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission \u2014 was passionate and long, lasting more than 20 minutes. \"Simply put,\" he said, \"corporations are not human beings. In the context of an election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Corporations cannot vote or run for office because they are managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interest may conflict in fundamental ways with the interest of voters. ... The rule announced today that Congress must treat corporate speakers exactly the like human beings in the political realm represents ... a radical change in the law.\" Behind the scenes, Stevens was often a persuasive and strategic thinker. In 1992, for instance, he played a pivotal role in the court's reconsideration of its landmark 1973 abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade. The court was split into three separate factions. Four justices to reverse Roe outright. Three to uphold its core but allow more regulation by the states. And two, including Stevens and Harry Blackmun, to uphold Roe entirely. Upon receiving the draft of the three middle-ground justices, Stevens suggested a reorganization of their opinion so that he and Blackmun \u2013 the author of Roe \u2014 could join most of it. That way, he noted, there would be a single opinion that was supported by a court majority of five. The three quickly agreed, and the opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey became the new law of the land. Just one regret In his 2010 NPR interview, Stevens said that in his 3 1/2 decades on the court, he really had just one regret: his 1976 vote to revive the death penalty by upholding a Texas death penalty statute. Stevens said that at the time the court had adopted many rules to limit the death penalty to a narrow category of offenders and to prevent what he called \"loading the dice\" for the prosecution. But over time, those limiting rules were abandoned. And so, in his later years, Stevens opposed most death sentences, winning rare but important victories, as when he wrote the court's opinion striking down capital punishment for the mentally retarded. He maintained he was undecided about retiring, but in late June of 2010 his lengthy oral dissent in the campaign finance case was marred by verbal flubs. He was so distressed by his performance that he sought a complete checkup by his doctor. There was nothing wrong, but not long thereafter, Stevens, then 90, announced his retirement. In the years afterward, he continued to be both physically and intellectually active, playing tennis and golf, and writing and speaking about the court and its work. When he thought the court in error, he lobbed critiques \u2014 as always, pointed, literate, and respectful. The very qualities that made him such a revered figure in the law.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a religious freedom summit at the Department of State on Tuesday. Pompeo is headed to Argentina, which is expected to announce it's joining an international coalition to counter Iran. As the United States has struggled to build support among its traditional allies in Europe to combat what it calls Iran's aggression, it has been forced to look elsewhere, such as Latin America, for support. This week, the Argentine government plans to designate the militant group Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, giving the Trump administration another ally in its push to build an international coalition to confront Iran. Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, is supported by Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Argentina later this week to take part in events honoring the 25th anniversary of the bombing of a Jewish Center in the Argentine capital, according to two sources familiar with details of the visit. \"This is going to make the United States very happy,\" said Seth Jones, a former Pentagon adviser who studies counterterrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The U.S. is having problems right now building a coalition against Iran.\" In Buenos Aires, Pompeo will participate in the second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial, aimed at highlighting challenges of terrorism in the hemisphere. Pompeo will also visit Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico and make a stop in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. The State Department didn't immediately respond to specific questions about Argentina's plans, but a senior State Department official discussing the trip said Tuesday that the administration wants Latin American countries to name and impose sanctions on terrorist organizations. \"We want to adopt a communique, the details of which will include things like a call for domestic designations regimes throughout the region so that countries have the same capabilities the United States does to impose sanctions on terrorist organizations and their financiers,\" the official told reporters. \"So over the short run we would like to see more countries adopt those laws, and over the longer run we would like to work with countries in the region to do joint designations of terrorists.\" As an example, the officials pointed to the establishment of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, where the United States works with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to combat terrorist financing. It includes a number of joint designations that target groups like Hezbollah and ISIS. Last month, President Trump said the U.S. was \"cocked & loaded\" to strike Iran. He stopped the strikes 10 minutes before they were to be launched \u2014 a move that could have accelerated the path to war. Soon after, Pompeo began a new effort to build an international coalition against Iran. But European leaders have resisted the United States' \"maximum pressure campaign\" against Iran. Several European nations do not want the United States to abandon the pact aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program. French and German leaders have continued to push to make reducing tensions a priority. Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, warned that \"the risk of war in the Gulf has not been averted.\" Instead of Europe, the secretary of state kicked off his coalition-building tour with visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that had been working to limit Iran's influence in the region. Now Pompeo will visit Latin America. Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich appeared to confirm plans to include Hezbollah on the designated list of organizations last week during a meeting with reporters following Cabinet meetings. \"What we are working on is the list to be composed of organizations with specific allegations,\" Bullrich said. \"In this case there are red alerts, we adhere to the list of the United Nations and we will add those terrorist organizations who have had activity in Argentina.\" Senior officials say the timing is not a coincidence. Pompeo's trip coincides with events honoring the victims of the 1994 bombing of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina, or AMIA, in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people. Buenos Aires prosecutors have charged Hezbollah with carrying out the bombing with Iranian support. The visit also comes as the center-right Argentine government of President Mauricio Macri positions itself for a reelection campaign this fall and is eager to signal its support from the U.S. Jones said the designation will be important for the Trump administration politically considering the challenges it has had generating international support. But he said it's unclear what concrete effects it will have on putting pressure against Iran. Benjamin Gedan, who was National Security Council director for South America during the Obama administration, said the designation will put pressure on other governments in Latin America that have been reluctant to take unilateral action against Iran. \"Though not a global power, Argentina's traumatic experience with Hezbollah makes it a compelling partner in White House efforts to highlight Iranian misconduct,\" said Gedan, now a senior adviser to the Wilson Center's Latin American Program and the director of its Argentina Project. Argentina has suffered two attacks attributed to Iran and has long taken a hard line on Tehran. Argentina's president has also depended on the Trump administration's economic support. The United States also helped push for the International Monetary Fund to extend Argentina its largest-ever $57 billion emergency loan last year. \"Argentina's financial survival depends upon IMF support, and the U.S. is its biggest backer at the fund,\" Gedan said. Ambassador Nathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, spoke last week at the Wilson Center during a commemoration event for the bombing. He said U.S. officials will work with Argentine officials to help \"attack the nexus between transnational crime and terrorism.\" He also promised future announcements. \"Secretary Pompeo recently emphasized that 'Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terror,' \" Sales said. \"It was true in 1994 and it's true now.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan testifies on security at the border and migrant detention during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Thursday. Updated at 6:12 p.m. ET Homeland Security acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan says the U.S. has apprehended more than 800,000 migrants attempting to enter the country since last October, calling the numbers staggering and unprecedented, and that the influx has \"challenged and overwhelmed every aspect of our border and immigration enforcement system.\" Still, McAleenan said DHS \"made significant strides in its effort to secure the border and help and protect migrants in our custody.\" McAleenan testified on Capitol Hill Thursday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, as Democrats step up oversight of an immigration crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border. He told the panel that fewer than 1,000 children have been separated from their families out of some 450,000 family units that have attempted to cross the border in the current fiscal year. McAleenan said a recently passed package of humanitarian aid has allowed CBP to construct four temporary tent-like shelters to house those placed in detention at the border, alleviating the overcrowding at some CBP facilities. That same money, he testified, resulted the a reduction in the \"in-custody population of children from a high of 2,700 to about 350 at the end of the day yesterday.\" He credited Trump administration policies for leading to a 28% reduction in border crossings last month. Democrats pushed back against what oversight committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., called McAleenan's attempts to \"sugarcoat\" conditions for detained migrants. When McAleenan insisted his agency was doing its \"level best,\" Cummings shot back: \"What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on, man. What is that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\" Watch the exchange below or at this YouTube link. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., held up pictures of men and children at DHS faculties she said she visited, saying, \"This would not be allowed as a kennel for dogs.\" But McAleenan said Congress specifically excluded funding for more beds at facilities run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, exacerbating the overcrowded conditions there. Cummings said, \"When I see the pictures and I hear the testimony. ... I am at a point where I begin to wonder whether there is an empathy deficit.\" But McAleenan insisted, \"We are taking care of these children.\" The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released a report on July 2 warning of \"dangerous overcrowding\" at CBP facilities. \"We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,\" investigators wrote. On another issue, McAleenan said an investigation is underway into a private Facebook group of CBP agents, some of whom reportedly posted racist and anti-immigrant statements. He said the CBP Office of Professional Responsibility has placed several individuals on administrative duties, issued cease and desist letters and is \"moving very quickly to hold people accountable for conduct that doesn't meet our standards.\" Asked by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was reportedly the subject of an obscene manipulated image on the site, whether the agents in involved were still on duty, McAleenan could not say. But he denied there was a dehumanizing culture at CBP. Even as acting homeland security secretary, McAleenan is still formally commissioner for Customs and Border Protection (Mark Morgan is serving as the acting commissioner). McAleenan began serving as the CBP commissioner in March 2018 before being elevated as the acting head of homeland security in April. The former homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, resigned from the post April 7 following a turbulent tenure at the post, and McAleenan was named as her replacement that day. Battle over border crisis Thursday's hearing comes amid a fight between Republicans and Democrats over which policies best deal with the humanitarian crisis at the border. The hearing also comes after dueling White House and congressional visits to evaluate conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border. On July 12, a group of freshman House Democratic members delivered emotional testimony before the House oversight committee on those concerns. The lawmakers recently traveled with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus at the beginning of the month to the border to examine the conditions. \"We do have a crisis at our border, it is one of morality,\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said. \"As we have seen this current strategy unfold, intentional and cruelly created by the Trump administration, dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America, in our America.\" As the lawmakers testified on July 12, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., led a Republican congressional delegation to a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The visit delivered dramatic images of more than 300 detained men, some wearing disposable face masks, standing in cramped quarters behind chain-link fences. \"For [Second Lady] Karen [Pence] and me, it was frankly heart breaking, as parents, to talk to young children who told us of having walked two to three months up the Peninsula to cross into our country,\" Pence said after the visit to a detention facility. \"That has to change.\" VP saw 384 men sleeping inside fences, on concrete w/no pillows or mats. They said they hadn\u2019t showered in weeks, wanted toothbrushes, food. Stench was overwhelming. CBP said they were fed regularly, could brush daily & recently got access to shower (many hadn\u2019t for 10-20 days.) pic.twitter.com/tHFZYxJF7C On Friday, a bipartisan group of House members, led by Reps. Lloyd Smucker, R-Penn., and Dean Phillips, D-Minn., plan to visit points of entry, a Border Patrol station and a processing center. The group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said they hope the fact-finding mission will lead to new solutions. \"The crisis at the border is one of the most pressing issues facing our nation and must be addressed by Congress,\" Smucker said in a statement. \"I am hopeful that the Problem Solvers Caucus can once again work together to put forth bipartisan solutions to this critical issue.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump again criticized a group of four House Democrats for their comments about his policies. He continued the back-and-forth ahead of a House vote condemning his tweets. Updated at 7:05 p.m. ET The House of Representatives approved a resolution Tuesday evening condemning the president for a series of racist tweets about four Democratic lawmakers. The vote was mostly along party lines, as the House split 240-187, with four Republicans supporting the nonbinding measure. Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Susan Brooks of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas joined with Democrats to rebuke the president, as did Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party to become an independent. The House was paralyzed for a substantial portion of the afternoon over legislative procedure. Republicans sought a ruling on the question: Does calling the president's tweets \"racist\" violate the rules of decorum established in the House? So an already heated debate turned to farce as the House voted on whether to sanction House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for characterizing the president's remarks as \"racist,\" as part of a debate on a resolution that also calls the president's remarks \"racist.\" At issue was the phrasing of Pelosi as she spoke in favor of the resolution. \"Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets,\" she said. \"To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.\" GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, objected to the language, calling it \"unparliamentary,\" and called for her comments to be \"taken down\" \u2014 officially removed from the record. When that happens, the lawmaker is no longer allowed to speak on the House floor for the remainder of the day. House rules prohibit impugning the motives of a person during legislative debate. There is no explicit rule that states that lawmakers cannot call comments \"racist,\" but there is precedent for declaring these sorts of characterizations out of bounds. The rules and precedents are outlined in Jefferson's Manual, which lays out parliamentary procedures. As House staff and lawmakers huddled to sort out what to do and expected a decision, the presiding chair of the House, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., unexpectedly dropped his gavel and declared that he was \"abandoning the chair.\" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer later delivered the ruling that Pelosi's words were not in order, but Democrats defeated a vote to strike them from the official congressional record. Both the attempted sanctioning of the speaker of the House and Cleaver's decision to walk off the floor and leave the House without a presiding officer are highly unusual developments in the House. The resolution states that the House \"strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" The president's weekend comments about four female members of Congress have done what Trump's remarks so often do: take control of the agenda in Washington, D.C. As the weekend began, lawmakers expected that this week would be focused primarily on issues like a proposal to raise the minimum wage, a budget deal and a vote holding the attorney general in contempt over the 2020 census. The president's tweets upended the whole order. His tweets, in which he implored four women of color to \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came,\" dominated the conversation in the capital \u2014 with Democrats condemning it and Republicans being asked to defend or denounce it. The statements targeted four freshman progressive lawmakers: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All but Omar were born in the United States. In response to the president's comments, Ocasio-Cortez responded that telling \"four American Congresswomen of color\" to \" 'go back to your own country' \" reflects the \"hallmark language of white supremacists.\" Ahead of the debate on the House floor, Democrats were warned to watch their language. In a meeting with his Democratic colleagues Tuesday morning, Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., reminded lawmakers about the House rules saying they cannot impugn the personal motives of the president. Pelosi suggested to the caucus that they could use phrasing like his \"words were racist,\" noting that such nuance allows them to make their point and stick within the rules. While some Republicans in the House and Senate have criticized the president's comments, GOP leadership in the House of Representatives stood with the president. Asked if the president's tweets were racist, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that they weren't. He added that he planned to vote against the Democratic resolution, dismissing it as \"it's all politics.\" House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney declined to address the president's comments directly, instead focusing on attacking the left. \"Our opposition to our colleague's beliefs has absolutely nothing to do with race or gender or religion,\" she told reporters. \"We oppose them and their policies because their policies are dangerous and wrong and would destroy America.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Jonathan Wiggs/Boston Globe via Getty Images hide caption A now-closed Irish pub in Lawrence, Mass., displayed an old \"Help Wanted/No Irish Need Apply\" \u2014 a common sight across the country in the mid-1800s. With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life. He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics \u2014 the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants. Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all \"go back\" where they came from. That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves of newcomers have been targeted by individuals, groups and even whole political parties. At times, the motivations have been economic, focusing on competition for jobs and such social goods as housing or welfare programs. But there has also been a recurrent theme of cultural differences \u2013 an emphasis on characteristics of religion or language that identify new arrivals as \"the other.\" Anti-immigration sentiments emerged in force starting in the 1830s, when U.S. citizens descended primarily from English and Scottish settlers bridled at the influx of Irish. Most of the arriving Irish were Catholic, prompting a hostile reaction among some Protestants that led to deadly riots in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The persistence of such prejudice made \"No Irish Need Apply\" one of the most iconic signs in the national memory. After the Irish, the hostile reaction extended to a surge of new arrivals in the 1840s from Germany, again largely Catholic. In ethnic terms, the Irish and Germans were akin to other colonial Americans (and to immigrants arriving from Scandinavia). But they were viewed as different, clannish and hard to assimilate. They were seen as not just competing for jobs but as threatening the social, cultural and political order. They were pilloried as susceptible to criminality and drunkenness and seen as loyal to the foreign power of the pope in Rome. In this anti-Catholic cartoon circa 1855, Pope Pius IX steps ashore the United States. Read the full captions on the Library of Congress website. Nathaniel Currier via Library of Congress hide caption In this anti-Catholic cartoon circa 1855, Pope Pius IX steps ashore the United States. Read the full captions on the Library of Congress website. In the 1840s and 1850s, political parties formed in the U.S. to oppose the permissive immigration policies of the time. Some of these parties embraced the term \"Native American,\" spawning the label \"nativist\" that has stuck to succeeding generations of immigration opponents. Perhaps the best known of these was the American Party, which began as a semi-secret society (\"The Order of the Star Spangled Banner\"), with members being told to deny any knowledge of it. When they claimed to \"know nothing\" of the group, they were pilloried as the \"Know Nothing\" party \u2013 a name that would long survive the entity itself. The party railed against the new arrivals as an economic, social and cultural threat that was bringing crime, disease, social unrest and the prospect of political takeover at the local level. A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\" The Ohio State University, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum hide caption A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\" The Know Nothings had attracted scores of members of the U.S. Congress at the height of their influence in the mid-1850s, stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of the Whigs. In 1856, they nominated Millard Fillmore, a former president and former Whig, as their national candidate. Fillmore got 21% of the popular vote but only a handful of Electoral College votes, as many of the Know Nothings crossed over to vote for John Fremont, the first nominee of the fledgling Republican Party. The 1860s brought the Civil War and a desperate need for soldiers, leading to greater acceptance of new arrivals who were willing to join the Union Army. In the years that followed, some immigrants found acceptance as veterans, others made their way west to farm the interior or work in its burgeoning cities. The Know Nothings were not an organized force again after the Civil War, but resistance to immigration never left the national conversation. The importation of Asians to work on the Western railroads and harvests introduced another enduring chapter of American nativism. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on nation of origin. Some of the jobs denied to Chinese workers were soon filled by Mexicans. Toward the end of the 1800s, the flow of immigrants from Europe swelled again and changed in its origin. The new arrivals now hailed from Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as from countries that had been sending opportunity seekers across the Atlantic for generations. The proportion of U.S. residents who were foreign-born hit 13.5% in the census report of 1911, the highest it had ever been and a level not reached again until the present decade. When the World War I ended, anti-immigration sentiment reached a new level of intensity as it swept much of the country, helping to fuel a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan among other extremist groups. An old association of immigration and urbanization was renewed when the census of 1920 showed immigrants had helped shift the center of U.S. population from rural areas to cities and big towns. Congress, dominated by members from rural, traditional parts of the country, simply refused to reapportion its seats and redraw election districts to reflect the new numbers. That refusal lasted through four biennial election cycles, during which time Congress also passed an emergency ceiling on annual immigration levels and then lowered that by half again in the Immigration Act of 1924. That law set quotas by country of origin and explicitly preferred Northern Europeans over all others. The official attitude in the 1920s and 1930s included an ambivalence toward refugees from conflicts around the world. In 1939, a German ship called the St. Louis tried to make port in Florida with more than 900 passengers, most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany. U.S. officials in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt refused to let them land. They tried to persuade Cuba to take them, but without success. The ship returned to Europe, where many of the passengers were later arrested. Researchers believe that more than 250 perished in the Holocaust. A generation later, in 1965, Congress passed a more liberal immigration law that eliminated quotas based on nation of origin. The law sought to reunite families and level the playing field for prospective immigrants around the world \u2013 and its impact went far beyond what its sponsors might have imagined. The proportion of foreign-born in the U.S. population rose again from just 5% in 1965 to 14% over the next half century. And these new waves of arrivals would be far more diverse than their predecessors were. They came not only from different parts of Europe but from Asia, Africa and South America as well. By the 1970s, the political focal point was the effect the law was having on the Southwest and the influx of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking populations. Pressure for changing the law grew as latter-day nativists again saw the new arrivals as a social, cultural and political challenge. Many of the same arguments made against previous generations of newcomers were lodged again against Hispanics, including that they would cling to their national culture and language and refuse to assimilate. Labor groups also sought to control the competition from workers willing to take lower wages. But there were powerful business interests, particularly from the agricultural sector, determined to preserve access to migrant workers. In 1986, the Simpson-Mazzoli Act sought to control future immigration, but also granted amnesty to millions of the undocumented people who were already residents. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. It was a compromise meant to appease all sides, but it satisfied few. President George W. Bush, who had long enjoyed high levels of Hispanic support as a candidate in Texas, threw his support behind a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in the mid-2000s. He was joined by Republican rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona and by the Democratic leadership. But conservatives more generally opposed the bill as another extension of amnesty, despite all the sponsors' denials. Since then, the Republican Party has moved far from the Reagan-Bush-McCain attitudes on immigration and embraced the nativist tradition that has also been an element in the mix of its history back to 1856. Declaring his presidential candidacy in June of 2015, Trump issued his much-quoted summary of immigrants: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. [sic] They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. \"It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all South and Latin America, and it's coming, probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence and we don't know what's happening.\" By repeating that these immigrants are \"not ... you,\" the president defined these immigrants as \"the other\" in stark terms. In the past two days, we have seen the president return to that blunt language in describing four women who were elected to Congress in November 2018, largely on the passion of their opposition to the nativism that he, and much of his party, have embraced. The battle lines could not be clearer. And it is a battle that is nearly as old as America itself. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Tamara Keith Franco Ordo\u00f1ez President Trump described the immigration plan presented at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday as \"the best of everything.\" Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption President Trump described the immigration plan presented at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday as \"the best of everything.\" Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET The White House announced Tuesday that it has quietly drafted a 620-page immigration bill and has lined up 10 Republican senators to co-sponsor the measure should it be introduced, according to a senior administration official involved in the process. This builds on a blueprint that President Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner announced in May and that addressed border security and legal immigration but didn't deal with the millions of people currently in the country illegally, including young people known as Dreamers. \"In Washington, I find a lot of people are very quick to say what they are against,\" Kushner said during a Cabinet meeting at which he shared details of the plan. \"But it's very important for us to articulate as an administration what we're for, but to do it in detail. And we're not afraid to put out details because we think that this proposal is a very very good proposal that really is great for America.\" The push for a new immigration bill comes just days after Trump ignited a furious controversy by tweeting that four non-white members of Congress should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four members are American citizens, and three of the four were born in the United States. When the immigration blueprint was first announced, it was greeted with mixed reviews and a heavy dose of skepticism about its political prospects. After that initial burst of energy, Congress seemed to ignore it and the White House stopped talking about it. But Kushner said it remained a top priority. \"The Trump administration, despite what some people say, believes in safe, legal immigration and is against illegal and random migration,\" he said. During the Cabinet meeting, Trump threw his support behind the Kushner-led plan. He called it \"compassionate\" and \"the best of everything.\" \"Our country really has a tremendous immigration gap,\" Trump said, calling the current system a \"maze of complexity.\" This bill, which hasn't been introduced and may not be, was drafted in consultation with about 25 Republican Senate offices and a handful of House Republicans, the official said. The senior administration official said the process included adding items, taking others out and tightening language. \"Now we are at a place where we feel like the bill is substantially complete,\" the official said. It's not clear how having legislative language will get this proposal any closer to becoming law, but the senior administration official said officials had planned to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday. That meeting has been postponed. McConnell has said that any major immigration effort needs to be bipartisan, but Democrats are unlikely to agree to sweeping border security measures without some kind of protections for the so-called Dreamers, brought to the country illegally as children, or the larger 11 million people in the country illegally. Distrust between the White House and Democrats is at perhaps its highest point. This distrust comes as the administration is being criticized for its handling of detained migrant children, its touting of planned immigration sweeps and its defense of the president's racist comments about several progressive lawmakers. But getting Democratic support is not necessarily the president's objective. White House officials recognize the challenges gaining support from Democrats, but a senior administration official said part of the goal is unifying key factions of the GOP about a path forward. Supporters say it also should give Republicans something to rally around for the 2020 elections. And Trump said as much in the Cabinet meeting, saying that \"if it doesn't get passed, it's a campaign issue.\" The senior administration official touted support its received from conservative groups and pundits, including Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham. He bragged that they were able to work with twenty-five Senate offices and a dozen House offices without any any leaks. \"While this plan doesn't make every needed change or fulfill every campaign promise, it offers the country a viable path forward in the face of Democrat immigration extremism,\" said RJ Hauman, the government relations director at FAIR, which advocates for stronger immigration enforcement. The plan includes an updated legal immigration system that replaces allowing entry to low-skilled workers with a merit-based system that prioritizes immigrants with special skills. It would also strengthen border security, increase interior enforcement and tighten asylum procedures. The proposal would also include installing a nationwide federal employment verification program, known as E-Verify, federal program to check whether new employees were legally allowed to work. Conservative groups have long pushed for the program, but big business has lobbied against it. But that may be changing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbied Congress against a national E-Verify mandate during the Bush and Obama administrations, has since welcomed the idea as long as it includes an improved guest worker proposal. The National Association of Manufacturers also supports mandatory employment verification system like E-Verify. When asked about the political realities of a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, a fast-approaching August recess, budget fights and an election year on the horizon, the official returned to what has been a common posture for the Trump White House. \"People in Washington think very conventionally all the time, and immigration is something that has been troubling people for 25 years. Everyone can say what they're against, but nobody can say what they're for,\" the official said. The goal for this document, the official argued, was \"seeing if we can unify the Republicans around this proposal.\" The official readily admitted that the White House could put this out and nothing will happen at all. And \"this will be something that we talk about during the election, but at least the president will be on record saying, 'This is what I am for' in a very detailed capacity.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Democrats are dealing with their largest primary pool in at least 40 years, and how they fare in raking in cash could separate the candidates in the pack. Here are the financial figures that the candidates, including President Trump, have reported to the Federal Election Commission, so far. These numbers reflect the total amount raised through the second quarter of 2019. This includes, among other sources, money raised from individual contributions and money transferred from other campaign accounts, such as a candidate's past Senate or House campaign: Loading... There are also more detailed fundraising metrics that give the public an idea about the priorities of the candidates and how they run their campaigns. Democrats have widely rejected, for example, support from corporate political action committees. While these committees have allowed businesses and trade groups in the past to funnel huge amounts of cash to eager candidates, Democrats have become increasingly worried about the appearance of businesses having undue influence over the political process. Campaigns are also making a point of touting the amount they have raised from small donors (those who give less than $200). These donors, who don't have to disclose their names or information, can represent the measure of a candidate's grassroots support. That, of course, doesn't always translate to primary delegates \u2014 as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders learned during his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2016 \u2014 but it certainly gives candidates staying power. Loading... Candidates are required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission through 2019 and then will switch to monthly reports if they've raised or spent at least $100,000.

        "title": "Trump's Racist Rhetoric Takes America Back Again : NPR",
        "captions": [],
        "texts": "ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The president's racist tweets tapped into one of the oldest strains in American politics - the fear and vilification of people perceived as other. That could be people of color, immigrants or, really, anyone unlike the speaker. NPR editor and correspondent Ron Elving is here to talk with us about this history. Hi, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Ari. SHAPIRO: You wrote on NPR.org that President Trump with his comments to the Democratic congresswomen was, quote, \"taking America back to where it came from.\" What do you mean by that? ELVING: I'm playing on the words of the president saying that these members of Congress should go back where they came from. SHAPIRO: Sure. ELVING: Nativism is as American as apple pie, Ari. It has been with us back to the early days of the republic. There was feeling against foreign-born citizens even then. They put it in the Constitution that a foreign-born person couldn't ever be president of the United States. And it took on a different form as more and more people did arrive from other countries, and people became fearful of those waves of immigration. SHAPIRO: And that extends beyond people who were born in other countries to people who are perceived as other. Three of the four congresswomen here are born in the U.S. ELVING: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: What were the peak periods of American nativism throughout U.S. history? ELVING: There were surges at several points in our history, beginning in the 1830s and 1940s, when famine and political upheaval in Ireland and Germany sent a huge influx of people into the country. And these people were Catholic, whereas most of the Americans at that time were Protestant, overwhelmingly. And also, they were arriving in such numbers that they disturbed people. So we go from fewer than 2 million foreign-born people at one point in the 1840s to, suddenly, within the decade, twice that many. And that was seen as fearful. It was seen as taking away jobs. But it was also seen as a threat to people's social order. And then, of course, you get another wave toward the end of the 1800s, early 1900s that came from all other parts of Europe - Eastern Europe, southern Europe. And in the 1920s, nativist feeling was so strong they passed a very restrictive immigration act in 1924, and they ignored the results of a census that showed these big influxes of immigrants had made the cities more populous than the countryside. SHAPIRO: And during these periods that there were all of these attacks on immigrants, did you also see attacks on people like the congresswomen today who are not immigrants, but are perceived as being different, just in the same way that President Trump in one breath attacks people crossing the border from Mexico and in another breath attacks people born in the U.S. who are brown or black? ELVING: The identification here of people who are different from whatever the perception of the old American, the true American - that's really what's crucial here. It really doesn't depend where you came from if you are perceived as being the other - for example, people who moved north in the Great Migration of African Americans in the 20th century, leaving behind the Southern states, moving to the north. And they were marginalized, and they were put in ghettos. And they were denied many of the opportunities of society and perceived as the other, even though they had been in the United States, at that point, for generations and generations. SHAPIRO: We've seen so many prominent figures use this kind of demonizing rhetoric. How unusual is it for a president? ELVING: Well, Calvin Coolidge, back in the 1920s, spoke of America becoming a dumping ground for undesirable people from other countries. So you have that kind of ugliness that far back. Richard Nixon had a very strong appeal to what he called the silent majority. He was clearly trying to speak to the sentiments of the white working class of his time, as opposed to both immigrant groups and also people of color in general. And then you have Ronald Reagan's approach, which was rather different. And in the immigration bill of 1986 - that reform bill actually granted amnesty to millions of people who were in the country without proper documents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: I'm going to do everything I can - and all of us in the administration are - to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. ELVING: And he thought it would finally give the United States full control of its borders. The amnesty worked, but it didn't really create the sort of border control that President Reagan thought it would. And it didn't do that much to discourage employers from bringing in and exploiting immigrant workers. SHAPIRO: So what stands out to you about President Trump's tapping this vein of American sentiment as being different from his predecessors? ELVING: Couple of things - one thing is that he personalizes it so much to individual people who are such high-identification citizens themselves - people who have actually been elected to Congress. That is highly unusual for a president of the United States. And also, it seems that even in Trump's own personal history as a politician - that he's gone from the birtherism when he was strongly suggesting that President Obama had not been born in the United States. That was, if you will, relatively subtle compared to where he was over this past weekend where he was highly personalizing and - if you will, the mask on his not only nativist sentiments, but racist. SHAPIRO: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks a lot, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Courtesy of the artist hide caption Kali Malone on the cover of The Sacrificial Code, one of two organ drone albums on this week's Viking's Choice. Is there a Sean Paul of metal or drone that Jake Gyllenhaal can enthusiastically shout out? A musical hype-person who \"makes every song better,\" but over blast beats or long, ponderous synths? Whoever it is, I would like to invite them to hop on a remix to any song featured on this week's entirely new Viking's Choice playlist available on Spotify and Apple Music. That's right, y'all \u2014 another week, another mix featuring ridiculously over-the-top metal from both Japan's Gyze and Babymetal (who just announced Asian Chaos and Metal Galaxy, respectively), a wild avant-pop collaboration between Nels Cline and Cibo Matto's Yuka C. Honda called CUP and Chela's \"Losing Belief,\" a cosmic whiz-banger to remind y'all that sometimes Viking's Choice is all about some cool-as-hell future-pop music. Per usual, my spidey sense has been pointing fingers all over Bandcamp. (Note: Some of these tracks can only be found on Bandcamp.) What if the metal aliens in Cynic took a long vape and exhaled a hypercolor cloud of noise fusion? Angel Marcloid answers that question, tempering the WTF hairpin-turns of previous experiments with ambient detritus. For a certain breed of extreme metal nerd, the names Rob Marton and Jon Chang elicit a searing squeal of joy (or a guttural growl, depending). Nearly two decades after Discordance Axis released the grindsterpiece The Inalienable Dreamless, No One Knows What the Dead Think is practically version 2.0, with chest-bursting riffs, insane blast beats and Chang's dynamic screams. Drone is sacred music. Kali Malone seeks the solemnity of the drone in the pipe organ, but leans into the vulnerability pushed through the air. There are much longer pieces on her new double album, but I'm drawn to the textural power of this melody's lament. Oh, you want more organ drone? The Swedish composer Ellen Arkbro \u2014 who also performs on Kali Malone's The Sacrificial Code \u2014 shifts monochromatic tones like a Rothko painting. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Damian Master's got riffs for days. And for a dude who thinks next-level on the regular, Broken Play ups his self-described \"purple metal\" game \u2014 simultaneously A Pregnant Light's thrashiest, punkest, but most tender record. Wait... only two people make this hypnotic, buzzy, technical, but oh-so-fun noise-rock? If you miss the old Hella, or think Orthrelm's 45-minute opus OV could've been pared down to four-minute bursts of dizzying guitar-and-drums delights, Imelda Marcos is your new jam. Atlanta's punnily named The Callous Daoboys follows a certain lineage of nutzoid metalcore from its hometown \u2014 think The Chariot, or even late '90s screamo band Portrait. The band takes a kitchen-sink approach to riffs, inscrutable style shifts and song titles, but with just the right amount of goofy twists and cyclonic breakdowns. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

        "texts": "In 1988, a determined Bob Boilen started showing up on NPR's doorstep every day, looking for a way to contribute his skills in music and broadcasting to the network. His persistence paid off, and within a few weeks he was hired, on a temporary basis, to work for All Things Considered. Less than a year later, Boilen was directing the show and continued to do so for the next 18 years. Significant listener interest in the music being played on All Things Considered, along with his and NPR's vast music collections, gave Boilen the idea to start All Songs Considered. \"It was obvious to me that listeners of NPR were also lovers of music, but what also became obvious by 1999 was that the web was going to be the place to discover new music and that we wanted to be the premiere site for music discovery.\" The show launched in 2000, with Boilen as its host. Before coming to NPR, Boilen found many ways to share his passion for music. From 1982 to 1986 he worked for Baltimore's Impossible Theater, where he held many posts, including composer, technician, and recording engineer. Boilen became part of music history in 1983 with the Impossible Theater production Whiz Bang, a History of Sound. In it, Boilen became one of the first composers to use audio sampling \u2014 in this case, sounds from nature and the industrial revolution. He was interviewed about Whiz Bang by Susan Stamberg on All Things Considered. In 1985, the Washington City Paper voted Boilen 'Performance Artist of the Year.' An electronic musician, he received a grant from the Washington D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities to work on electronic music and performance. After Impossible Theater, Boilen worked as a producer for a television station in Washington, D.C. He produced several projects, including a music video show. In 1997, he started producing an online show called Science Live for the Discovery Channel. He also put out two albums with his psychedelic band, Tiny Desk Unit, during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Boilen still composes and performs music and posts it for free on his website BobBoilen.info. He performs contradance music and has a podcast of contradance music that he produces with his son Julian. Boilen's first book, Your Song Changed My Life, was published in April 2016 by HarperCollins. Rock band \"Blind Faith\" pose for a portrait in 1969.

        "texts": "Josh Rogosin Credit: NPR Don't see the video above? Click here. Sting and Shaggy might not be the most likely musical pairing. But one thing is certain, they love playing each other's music. On a bright autumn morning, the legends arrived at the NPR Music office bleary-eyed yet excited to play for the diverse staff of Shaggy and Sting fans. What surprised many of my NPR colleagues is just how well the collaboration works. Their success as a duo shouldn't come as a total shock. After all, pulsing through many Police songs (Sting's famed band of the '70s and '80s) is a Reggae backbeat. It's impossible not to hear the influence in classics like \"Walking On The Moon\" and \"So Lonely.\" Shaggy (zoinks! - his nom de guerre comes from the Scooby-Doo cartoon character) was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He moved to New York when he was 18 and his music evokes only good vibes. The positive energy he brought to their opening song, \"Englishman [and Jamaican] In New York,\" had everyone in the room grinning ear to ear, \"early morning Reggae style,\" as he put it. After the tune, Sting announced \"I never sang that song before 8 PM... Ever!\" Sting's familiar, raspy voice was accompanied by his battered 1957 Fender Precision bass he's plucked for over 25 years. His long-time guitarist and collaborator, Dominic Miller, strummed Reggae offbeats on acoustic guitar and co-wrote the hauntingly beautiful \"Shape Of My Heart.\" That song is mashed-up with Juice Wrld's \"Lucid Dream,\" sung by Gene Noble, offering a refreshing counter to Sting's nuanced melody. Shaggy affectionately refers to his collaborator as \"Stingy,\" putting his arm around him mid-performance. It's easy to see the camaraderie that being on the road together affords these veteran musicians, to say nothing of the breath of fresh air they bring to each other's music.

        "texts": "Lulu Garcia-Navarro Ned Wharton Ephraim Bugumba's song \"Voices in My Head\" was a stand-out entry in this year's Tiny Desk Contest. Nolis Anderson/Courtesy of the artist hide caption Ephraim Bugumba's song \"Voices in My Head\" was a stand-out entry in this year's Tiny Desk Contest. Quinn Christopherson won 2019's Tiny Desk Contest, but many of the other 6,000-plus entries impressed and moved the contest's judges. This summer, Weekend Edition continues to spotlight some of the stand-out contestants. One stand-out entrant is Ephraim Bugumba, who submitted his song \"Voices in My Head\" for the contest. Currently residing in DeKalb, Ill., Bugumba originally hails from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the Congolese village where he was born, it is an honored tradition to tell history, sacred myths and family lore through music \u2014 so it makes perfect sense that the 23-year-old musician also goes by the name StoryTeller. The story that Bugumba tells in \"Voices in My Head\" is one of emotional scars and vulnerability. Bugumba, a refugee who came to the United States with his family seven years ago, survived the 1999 massacre at Makobola that left as many as 600 dead. Bugumba was 3 years old at the time of the massacre, and 16 when he arrived in the U.S. For the years in between, he says, his family moved from country to country near the Congo in \"whatever ways possible.\" After his mother had disguised him as a young girl \u2014 because the rebels behind the massacre often killed boys or turned them into child soldiers \u2014 they fled the Congo for a refugee camp in Tanzania. From Tanzania, they walked and hitchhiked their way to Malawi, then to Mozambique, and eventually to Johannesburg, South Africa for 10 years. Bugumba's father had royal lineage that prevented the family from returning safely to the Congo, so they filed a case for refugee status with the UNHCR. Finally, in 2012, the Bugumba family emigrated as refugees to the U.S. Through that 13-year ordeal, music acted as a sort of oasis for Bugumba. He describes how, before the Makobola massacre, music centered his family on a daily basis \u2014 and how, after the massacre, that tradition took on even more importance. \"We gathered at 8 p.m. every night and we sang,\" Bugumba says. \"We read hymns and my mom told us some stories from the Bible. That's how we got through the regular days. Then, when we were fleeing in the forest and the wilderness, in all that madness, my parents would always still gather us, and we would still pray and we would sing. So it became our safety place. In a world where everything was just uncertain \u2014 you were not sure if your next meal was going to come around, you were not sure if you were going to make it to the next meal \u2014 music was the one thing that was sacred and safe. I knew that 8 PM was gonna come along and we were gonna have a good time.\" In the U.S., singing and playing music has continued to play a central role in Bugumba's life. In 2018, he was one of the top 50 contestants on American Idol. And beyond his reality TV stint, Bugumba finds a critical emotional outlet in the music that he writes. He says that his relationship with his girlfriend has helped him recognize his learned tendency to suppress emotions in other ways. \"Growing up, we learned to suppress our emotions,\" Bugumba says. \"It's not that we don't want to value it; It's just life didn't allow it. So we learned to conceal, per se, because everybody was traumatized, and you were just another traumatized person. The most important part of life was surviving. So emotions weren't really that important.\" But his girlfriend, who Bugumba described as \"a green-eyed beauty from the Quad Cities\" in a letter he wrote to the Tiny Desk judges, has encouraged him to express his feelings. \"She comes from a different world, where emotions are very important, very valued. She is a very expressive person,\" Bugumba says. \"She wants to talk about her emotions; she wants to do everything based off of emotions. And I found myself struggling, because I didn't know how to tell her when I didn't feel OK.\" This struggle is the subject of Bugumba's song \"Voices in My Head,\" which itself serves as a space for his emotional expression. \"That's the role music plays,\" Bugumba explains. \"My best way of expressing myself is through music. Words are a little hard for me sometimes.\" Bugumba says that he hopes his music can also inspire others to feel hope and show vulnerability. \"I want to give hope. I want to remind people that no matter how dark it gets, it can always get better,\" Bugumba says, reflecting on his work. \"I want to tell people that it's OK to talk about not being OK. I want to allow people to express themselves. I want to allow vulnerability, even amongst men. We have a great fear of being perceived as weak when we cry, or when we laugh too loud, when we show compassion. I just want to let us all know that it's OK \u2014 that we're created for a reason. We have those things so we could get through life with them.\" Listen to the full aired interview through the audio link. Rosalind Faulkner contributed to the digital version of this story.

        "texts": "Stephen Thompson is an editor and reviewer for NPR Music, where he writes the advice column The Good Listener, fusses over the placement of commas and appears as a frequent panelist on All Songs Considered. Since 2010, Thompson has been a fixture on the weekly NPR roundtable podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour, which he created and developed with NPR correspondent Linda Holmes. In 2008, he and Bob Boilen created the NPR Music video series Tiny Desk Concerts, in which musicians perform at Boilen's desk. In 1993, Thompson founded The Onion's entertainment section, The A.V. Club, which he edited until December 2004. In the years since, he has provided music-themed commentaries for the NPR programs Weekend Edition Sunday, All Things Considered and Morning Edition, on which he earned the distinction of becoming the first member of the NPR Music staff ever to sing on an NPR newsmagazine. (Later, the magic of AutoTune transformed him from a 12th-rate David Archuleta into a fourth-rate Cher.) Thompson's entertainment writing has also run in Paste magazine, The Washington Post and The London Guardian. During his tenure at The Onion, Thompson edited the 2002 book The Tenacity Of The Cockroach: Conversations With Entertainment's Most Enduring Outsiders (Crown) and copy-edited six best-selling comedy books. While there, he also coached The Onion's softball team to a sizzling 21-42 record, and was once outscored 72-0 in a span of 10 innings. Later in life, Thompson redeemed himself by teaming up with the small gaggle of fleet-footed twentysomethings who won the 2008 NPR Relay Race, a triumph he documents in a hard-hitting essay for the book This Is NPR: The First Forty Years (Chronicle). A 1994 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Thompson now lives in Silver Spring, Md., with his two children, his girlfriend, their four cats and a room full of vintage arcade machines. His hobbies include watching reality television without shame, eating Pringles until his hand has involuntarily twisted itself into a gnarled claw, using the size of his Twitter following to assess his self-worth, touting the immutable moral superiority of the Green Bay Packers and maintaining a fierce rivalry with all Midwestern states other than Wisconsin.

Every year at NPR Music we debate which hits might be remembered as \"the song of the summer\" \u2014 sometimes it's a frothy pop song, or a star-packed hip-hop banger, or simply a song that gets played on the radio over and over again until we're beaten into submission.

Daniel Warren Johnson/Courtesy of Skybound Comics hide caption Daniel Warren Johnson's Murder Falcon comic features an anthropomorphic, bionic falcon who kills demons from the underworld by the power of guitar shredding. Stream: Spotify, Apple Music. Over four years ago, I received an illustration in the mail of a viking warrior astride a giant boar, blowing an ancient horn that had to have been carved from a tree that's seen some history. The accompanying note said the drawing was inspired by me, which is just about the most flattering and kick-ass thing anyone could say about someone who writes about metal, punk and experimental music. \"Here's a thank-you drawing of @totalvibration heralding great metal bands & opening my ears to awesome new music!\" he tweeted. (That drawing is framed and hanging above my bed, and is now the artwork for the weekly Viking's Choice playlist.) That artist is Daniel Warren Johnson, author and illustrator of the comics Space Mullet and the Eisner-nominated Extremity. It's easy to become absorbed by Johnson's detail \u2014 he loves gratuitous blood splatter, fantastically labyrinthine-lined monsters and onomatopoeic fight words \u2014 but that visual feast always serves a purpose, to punctuate an emotional note like a pinch harmonic squealed from the depths of the soul. Johnson's extremely metal comic Murder Falcon, now available as a trade paperback, is not just a comic about heavy metal. I mean, it is \u2014 there's an anthropomorphic, bionic falcon who kills demons from the underworld by the power of guitar shredding! Murder Falcon is also full of metal references, from the Pelican and Power Trip patches on a character's battle vest to a run of variant comic book covers playing on classic metal album artwork like Bolt Thrower's War Master, Iron Maiden's Somewhere in Time and Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power. There's plenty of inspiration to make a playlist from those notes alone, but over eight issues, the lead character Jake struggles with pain that doesn't resolve neatly into a triumphant chord. Between and especially during battles to save humanity from evil, the community around Jake battles for his mental health. Murder Falcon understands that depression isn't so easily fixed, it's ever-present. These are heavy metal anthems that fight heavy times. The battles found in tunes by Bolt Thrower and Manilla Road come from real life and fantasy, but also from within. We begin in the 1980s with Racer X's \"Living the Hard Way\" (featured early in the comic in a bonding moment between Jake and Murder Falcon), barrel through Chastain's \"I Fear No Evil\" (when Leather Leone wails, \"I'm in command, I call the shots,\" it echoes this one heartbreaking moment, in particular) and \"Turn Up the Night\" with Dio-era Black Sabbath. Both the Canadian doom-metal band Smoulder and Cleveland black 'n' roll maniacs Midnight brandish steel in the face of certain death. \"Don't fly close to the sun / My battle's just begun,\" sings Trevor William Church on Haunt's \"If Icarus Could Fly,\" a neoclassical shredfest worthy of Randy Rhoads. But sometimes you blaze through the \"frosty path to sorrow\" like Immortal, and sometimes, as Darkthrone's Fenriz so eloquently puts it, you just need to tell someone to \"f*** off and die.\" More often than not, in the throng of banging heads, you find your family. That's why this playlist ends with \"Thank You\" by High Spirits, the high-energy heavy metal band that radiates positivity with a song about friendship. \"Looking out to tomorrow / Facing the sun we will stand / When the night comes alive again / To the dark we will run hand in hand.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

Netflix hide caption Thom Yorke and Dajana Roncione in a scene from the video for Yorke's ANIMA, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Radiohead's Thom Yorke released his third official solo album, ANIMA, early Thursday morning, along with a short companion film featuring three tracks from the album. Produced by Nigel Godrich, the songs build on the anxious, heavily electronic work Yorke has explored outside Radiohead (and within Atoms for Peace) in recent years, blending beat-driven, polyrhythmic fare with the moodier, dreamier likes of ANIMA's \"Dawn Chorus.\" But if you really want to prepare yourself for the journey the album takes, head over to Netflix for the stunning video. The short film opens with Yorke on a train. One of many drowsy interlocked travelers, he sees a woman (played by Yorke's real-life girlfriend, Italian actress Dajana Roncione), and as he searches for her in an attempt to return a lunchbox she's left behind, he's enmeshed with an inventively staged array of dancers on a floor that tilts under their feet. By the time \"Dawn Chorus\" rolls around, he and Roncione become locked in a dreamy embrace as the film winds to its artful conclusion, completing a compact work that feels not just artful, but also warm \u2014 and uncharacteristically revealing. It's tempting to minimize the momentousness of ANIMA's roughly 15-minute filmed counterpart; to view it as a promotional piece, or simply a long-form music video that stitches together lengthy chunks of the songs \"Not the News,\" \"Traffic\" and \"Dawn Chorus.\" But the film is considerably more ambitious than that: It's directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, for one thing, with truly inventive choreography by Damien Jalet, and it conveys an emotional story about the pursuit of love in a world that can be overwhelming and unkind. (Anderson and Yorke have worked together before, collaborating on the videos for \"Daydreaming\" and \"The Numbers\" from Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool). The ANIMA film is especially effective at fleshing out the tone and meaning behind the work of an artist whose intentions can feel obtuse or otherwise at arm's length. But what really jumps out here is Yorke's own gameness and sense of play: He doesn't just dance, opting instead to throw himself into intricate, elaborately choreographed, unquestionably emotional routines.

Annabel Mehran/Courtesy of the artist hide caption Wilco has announced it'll release the band's 11th studio album later this year. Drawing its title from the poetry of Friedrich Schiller \u2014 and Beethoven's Ninth symphony \u2014 Wilco's Ode to Joy will feature what frontman Jeff Tweedy calls \"really big, big folk songs,\" including the album's first single, \"Love is Everywhere (Beware).\" \"Right now I'm frightened how love is here,\" sings Tweedy over wistfully arpeggiated guitars. \"Beware / Our love is everywhere.\" It's both an affirmation of love's enduring power and a warning that it could be undermined at any moment. Tweedy says the album overall is defiantly joyful in the face of global political and cultural upheaval. \"The record is, in a weird way, an ode,\" he says in a statement announcing the album. \"This terrible stuff is happening, this deepening sense of creeping authoritarianism that weighs on everybody's psyche on a daily basis, and you're allowed to feel a lot of things at once. And one thing that is worth feeling, that is worth fighting for, is your freedom to still have joy even though things are going to s***.\" Ode to Joy arrives during a particularly prolific creative period for Tweedy. In the last five years he's released three solo albums (Together at Last, Warm and Warmer), two more Wilco records (Star Wars and Schmilco) an album with his son under the name Tweedy (Sukierae) and wrote and produced the album If All I Was Was Black with Mavis Staples. Last year he also published his memoir, Let's Go (So We Can Get Back). Ode to Joy is due out Oct. 4 on dBpm Records. Artwork and full track list below: 1. Bright Leaves2. Before Us3.

I have some thrilling discoveries, but I begin the show with an artist we've been covering all these 20-plus years of All Songs Considered: Wilco. The band has a new album coming called Ode to Joy, and I play the first single from that record, a song that Jeff Tweedy says is a reminder \"to act with more love and courage and less outrage and anesthetized fear.\" There are some discoveries I'm thrilled to play, including an artist known as Pearla who makes music worth getting lost in. You'll also hear Erin Durant, whose music mixes mountain dulcimer and the electronics of TV On The Radio's Kyp Malone with Erin's lulling voice. Then there's these surprises: Khruangbin reimagines their 2018 album Con Todo El Mundo as a dub album! And Brian Eno, along with Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois, expand on their decades-old project Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks with 11 new tracks. And for lovers of Sylvan Esso's Nick Sanborn, I play something from his new project Rosenau & Sanborn which mixes modular synths and guitar loops into a new world of sound.

The album, Jaime, is named after her sister, who died of cancer when they were both teenagers. \"The title is in memoriam,\" says Howard in a press release announcing the record. \"And she definitely did shape me as a human being. But the record is not about her. It's about me. I'm pretty candid about myself and who I am and what I believe. Which is why I needed to do it on my own.\" Jaime's first single is a swirling, punch-drunk and funk rumination on the ways repeated mistakes can hold us back. \"I just don't want to be back in this place again,\" she sings. \"I mean, I done cried a little / Tried a little / Failed a little.\" Howard says this is the most honest and personal she's been in her music but felt it was time to do something on her own, outside of Alabama Shakes. \"I turned 30 and I was like, 'What do I want the rest of my life to look like?' Do I want to play the same songs until I'm 50 and then retire, or do I do something that's scarier for me? Do I want people to understand me and know me, do I want to tell them my story?

Every time I've seen Erin Rae live, she transforms her quiet storms into different hues of squalling introspection. Her performance at the Tiny Desk opens with a soft tide of ambient tones \u2014 both a way to ease into the song but also understand that life's unease is ever-present. Then a lilting acoustic melody introduces \"Bad Mind,\" a stunning statement of identity from a Nashville singer-songwriter who shares the secrets we keep close. Erin Rae writes songs about letting go of lovers and thoughts that weigh you down, embracing contentment and recognizing the small moments that add up to the grand scheme. But more importantly her songs make you just sit in your thoughts for a tick longer. Putting On Airs, the album Erin Rae released last year, wraps these subtle shifts of folkloric psychedelia in deeply personal songwriting that hits hard two, three listens in. She's joined here by Jerry Bernhardt, a treasured collaborator and a guitarist who knows how to play decorative but unobtrusive figures. He and drummer Dom Billet both appear on Putting On Airs, taking those arrangements and stretching them out at the Tiny Desk with Mellotron/Rhodes piano player Ben Tanner and bassist Joe Garner. Inventive in these altered live versions, this Tiny Desk closes with \"the summer jam,\" as Erin Rae jokingly calls \"Love Like Before,\" offering another opportunity to reflect as you bop: \"Been looking for something I can't track down / Love that I knew before.\" Erin Rae: vocals, guitar; Ben Tanner: Fender Rhodes, Mellotron; Joe Garner: bass; Dom Billett: drums; Jerry Bernhardt: guitar Producers: Lars Gotrich, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Patrick Boyd, Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Kara Frame, Jeremiah Rhodes; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Paul Georgoulis; Photo: Olivia Falcigno/NPR The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

After a glass (or two \u2014 or, maybe, several) of ros\u00e9, you almost work up the nerve to shoot your summer crush an innocent text: Hey, quick question. What's the exact time, date and location of your birth? Just wanna make sure we're astrologically compatible lol! OK, so maybe you're coming on a little strong \u2014 but what if she's a sensitive Pisces and you're a hot-headed Leo? What if your moon sign doesn't mesh with his rising? What's the perfect song to convince a judicious Libra to go on a second date? Not to flatten anyone's personalities, of course. Even the most invested astrologers know that people are more than just one characteristic. So we've assembled a playlist that highlights each sign's best features and some of their more challenging attributes. Starting with Aries \u2014 the first sign of the astrological calendar \u2014 all the way through Pisces, each duo of songs pays homage to your (or your love interest's) highlights and lowlights for you to mull over while sipping some pink wine. (We've intended these for your sun sign, but feel free to cross-reference with your rising sign, too, if you'd like.) Aries, we know you can easily be the coolest person in the room \u2014 which is why our playlist kicks off with Anderson .Paak's \"Come Down\" \u2014 but you can also risk being a touch self-involved (taking a cue from Taylor Swift's \"Me!\"). Taurus, you're as luxurious and decadent as Kehlani's \"Honey\" \u2014 and if you sometimes take it too far, at least you have Ariana Grande's lead on \"7 rings\" to follow. Gemini, you crave constant learning and innovation (the shapeshifting production on Tame Impala's \"Borderline\" runs as background music to your day), but that also means you can teeter into know-it-all territory fairly quickly (cue Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\") Frank Ocean (we've included his song \"Self Control\") is a natural soundtrack for Cancers \u2014 perhaps the most sensitive sign of them all \u2014 but they can often feel misunderstood when they get stuck in their own heads (like in Courtney Barnett's moody track \"City Looks Pretty\"). This playlist will publish during Leo season \u2014 as if we needed another reason to celebrate Leos. Your optimism and collaborative spirit helps others step up their game (like Rosal\u00eda, J Balvin and El Guincho on \"Con Altura\") but your headstrong nature means you might \"flip the switch\" \u2014 as Drake sings on \"Nonstop\" \u2014 and bulldoze a debate at a moment's notice. Beyonc\u00e9 is the embodiment of a Virgo \u2014 meticulous, reliable and basically a perfectionist, just like on \"Formation.\" But that tendency for perfection means you can sometimes over-analyze every move, the way Solange does in \"Cranes in the Sky.\" Libra, you can be a picture of balanced calm \u2014 sit back, pour some wine and listen to Kacey Musgraves' \"Golden Hour\"; just make sure your desire for stable companionship doesn't tip into the heartsick chaos towards the end of Mitski's \"Nobody.\" Scorpio, you're a charismatic rule breaker, but you always have the moves to back up any \"Boasty\" moves (actor/DJ/rapper Idris Elba understands). But confidence, when left unchecked, can turn into cockiness and invite ire; just ask Megan Thee Stallion on \"Cocky Af\": \"You don't like me, get in line, hoe / I be on yo' mind, though.\" Robyn's \"Ever Again\" has all the infectious warmth and endless optimism we love from our Sagittarius friends \u2014 so long as they don't turn into your \"sweetheart psychopathic crush\" (Lorde's words from \"The Louvre,\" not ours!) Riri's \"Work work work work work\" is the obvious pump-up mantra for the slow-and-steady Capricorn, but it's OK to stop every once and awhile and enjoy your success. As Skepta says on \"Energy (Stay Far Away), \"I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice.\" The last air sign of the zodiac, Aquarius is delightfully free-spirited (Bj\u00f6rk is a style icon, so we included \"Venus As A Boy\") but can also wind up coming across as aloof (though hopefully as charming as SZA makes aloofness seem on \"The Weekend\"). And as a highly emotive water sign, Pisces, you are artistic, compassionate and wise \u2014 sometimes beyond their years like teenage phenom Koffee on \"Toast.\" But being so in tune with emotions can make one heartache feel world-shattering (You might as well get \"You make my earth quake\" tatted \u00e0 la Tyler, The Creator's \"EARFQUAKE\"). So open a bottle and get to stargazing. You don't need to believe in astrology to believe in ros\u00e9wave. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

But before we head down the sad road I'll kick off the show on a high note with new music from the three sisters known as Joseph and a song that encourages everyone to fight for what they believe and never give up. \"Fighter,\" the lead single from Joseph's Good Luck, Kid, was inspired by real-life drama when the sister act nearly broke up. But \"Fighter\" isn't about fighting with each other but rather, in the words of band member Natalie Schepman, \"for each other.\" Good Luck, Kid is out Sep. 13 on ATO Records. \"Fighter,\" the lead single from Joseph's Good Luck, Kid, was inspired by real-life drama when the sister act nearly broke up.

Seriously, if you'd been sitting on last week's mix of metal, punk, drone and other misfit music for a late-night sesh, it's gone \u2014 like dust in the wind, dude. Am I going to make an entirely new playlist every week? Maybe. Once upon a time, I was a college radio DJ and lived for the mix. Do I neurotically cram enough music into my ears to sustain such passion? I mean, yes. Case in point: we've now got new jams by goth queen Chelsea Wolfe, the surreal downtempo-pop of Simulation, death metal meatheads Devourment, some unreleased Tangerine Dream and \"Blood from a Stone\" by Sheer Mag, who reminds us that the best rock and roll being made in America right now is by a bunch of Philly punks. Per usual, I've been doing high kicks \u2014 Jeanne-Claude Van Damme-style \u2014 over some Bandcamp finds. I must be on Broadway. (Note: Some of these tracks can only be found on Bandcamp.) The positivity that spins throughout Life is Spiritual oozes an off-kilter charm \u2014 Frank Hurricane just wants to love someone, and that includes a batch of juggalos in this winding and weird Appalachian blues tale. Honestly, some of the most open-hearted songwriting I've heard in a long time. Your mileage may vary (or be completely non-existent) when it comes to black metal made to sound like a collapsing black hole. But this collaboration understands that the darker depths of psychedelia can wield some brilliantly colored nightmares. I pretty much always want to hear solo saxophone records made in cavernous tunnels and reverberant rooms. Lea Bertucci plays with the decay of the grain elevator at Silo City in Buffalo, N.Y., like a spinning top that doesn't so much end, but seeps into our spiraling consciousness. You've jumped through time, a fraught journey immediately soothed by an oblong landscape \u2014 where the laws of physics break down to shift shapes and shape sounds into the calm of your new being. Also, there's a sweet synth soundtrack. Jake Xerxes Fussell, Marisa Anderson and Ami Dang are familiar names on Quilt of the Universe, a cosmic patchwork of a tape compilation from Spinster Sounds. But less known (to me) is this British folksinger/fiddler and Tuvan throat-singer duo, a sedate, bewildering combination of folkloric drone. Jim O'Rourke may never release a singer-songwriter album again, but regularly drops electronic excavations from the deep abyss. The 37-minute \"Sigaretstraat\" is a master class in patience, dynamics and sublime dissonance. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

The video features delicate, sparsely-colored artwork and animation from Douglas Miller. Shelley says the album overall \"is built as a haven for overstimulated heads in uncertain times. ...Whether it be a physical place or an idea, everyone needs a place of comfort. One where we can look out again from that place of calm and see how to best act and to be in an uncertain world.\" Though Shelley recorded Like the River Loves the Sea far from her native Kentucky in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, she says she stayed close to the \"many musical traditions that comprise what we now call Kentucky music,\" the core sound on her previous recordings. This is her first full-length release in two years, following her 2017 self-titled album and 2018 EP Rivers and Vessels. Like the River Loves the Sea is out Aug. 30 on No Quarter Records.

Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images hide caption I told this story on the 40th anniversary of the first moonwalk, but on this 50th anniversary, like grandpa, I'll tell it again. It was July 20, 1969 and I had tickets to see the supergroup of supergroups: Blind Faith. I was psyched until I realized that it was to be the night of the very first manned moon landing \u2014 and the very first time a human would walk on the moon. I was so torn. In my teen and preteen life I'd watched every major rocket launch. I loved the space program. The moon landing was to be this incredible and uncertain event, but I was also a music fanatic (surprise), and the idea of seeing Eric Clapton (he was so good back then), Stevie Winwood (he was so good back then) and Ginger Baker (he is still pretty good) was a one-shot chance. I was still kicking myself for missing the Goodbye Cream Tour the year before. The moon landing was scheduled around late afternoon or early evening \u2014 I can't recall \u2014 but the astronauts were expected to take a rest before they did their walk. So I figured I could go to the concert and drive back from Baltimore in time to see the walk. It didn't happen that way. The moonwalk occurred earlier than planned, or at least earlier than the television news had led me to believe. Ginger Baker wouldn't come out (or so we were told) until the moonwalk happened. There were no big screens at the Baltimore Civic Center and no simulcasts. When my friend Pete and I got home, the astronauts were just a few steps away from their re-entry into the lunar lander. There were no instant replays, either. I've never looked back with regret. To me, the decision to hear Clapton, Winwood, and Baker (and Ric Grech) reflects who I was as a 16-year-old. In many ways, it reflects who I still am. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the date of the concert as July 21, 1969.

Cyriel Jacobs/Courtesy of the artist hide caption Drag queen and songwriter Trixie Mattel's ros\u00e9wave playlist includes songs by Dusty Springfield, The Zombies and a handful of musical drag queens. Stream: Spotify, Apple Music. Editor's note: When we decided to include an LGBT-themed playlist in this season of ros\u00e9wave, in honor of Pride Month, one name immediately came to mind: Trixie Mattel. A celebrated drag queen and winner of season three of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, Trixie Mattel is also a quirky folk singer-songwriter in her own right. Her essay will resonate with anyone (drag fan or not) who has reached for a pink drink and good tunes alongside a Friday night makeover, and her playlist features songs beloved pop acts and several former Drag Race competitors. It's 5 p.m. on a balmy Friday evening in Milwaukee, Wis. You don't have to be to the club until the midnight show, but you might as well start early. Post-shower, you package yourself in a lilac chenille robe. You think to yourself, \"Lilac Chenille would be a great drag name\" as you tiptoe down the hallway. Although you possess a comically bald head, you've crowned yourself with a bath towel wrapped around ever-so. You lean into the kitchen counter to reach the wine goblets on the highest shelf. After all \u2014 a bigger wine glass will make your hands look smaller. And Pride only comes once a year; if you're not drinking a pink wine, what are you doing? Getting show-ready can be a creative experience: painting our egg shells to reveal our truer more-vibrant yolks. Getting in drag can also be \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a drag. Pinching, taping, tucking, and sometimes stapling, the transformation can at times feel less magical and more methodical. Expectedly, the more often you do drag, the less special the transformations feels. The antidote to a mundane makeover? A playlist. The right soundtrack can put you on stage even behind the curtain. My personal \"getting in drag\" playlist always begins with Imperial Teen's \"Yoo Hoo.\" One minute, I'm an unprepossessing balding introvert with calloused hands \u2014 then suddenly, I'm a teenage viper doing her pre-lunch touch-ups after some light morning manslaugher between girlfriends. (If you don't understand this Jawbreaker reference, please stay away from me and my daughter.) Clink your pink drinks! It's time for \"Spooky (Quinten 909 Extended Remix).\" Imagine you're Dusty Springfield, the blue-eyed soul and paragon of '60s style. In charcoaled panda eye makeup and a bleached blush lip, Dusty sings \"Spooky\" with a flirtatious swirl that is perfect for a ros\u00e9 refill. Swish down the hall while your lashes dry and rehydrate. Lashed, lacquered and a little buzzed, it's time for hair. Amanda Lepore's \"My Hair Looks Fierce\" queues up as you switch gears. You unravel your headwrap and lower a bawdy bubble of synthetic fibers onto your painted head. After adhering the lace to the skin, you drain your glass as you zip cheap go-go boots onto your expensive legs. Five to seven puffs of MAC Candy Yum-Yum perfume swim around you as you polish off the slim bottle of ros\u00e9. Britney's version of \"Tom's Diner\" plays as you pin your hair so tight that you swear you feel the sharp end touch your brain. Beep beep! The Grindr app flashes across your cracked iPhone 3. You don't respond \u2014 you're mid-manicure. Besides, it's a men's hookup app; this phone currently belongs to a woman. Time to bolt. \"Chapstick\" by Todrick Hall and Trixie Mattel kisses you goodbye from Alexa's speaker. Your Uber XL pulls up outside your four-story walk-up. You runway jaywalk across the street to the idling Toyota Sienna. Davit, your driver, greets you. \"You smell delicious. What perfume is that?\" You cross your legs at the ankle like Mount Rose American Teen Princess before you reply: \"Ros\u00e9.\" The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: Recently, we've been listening to some of the standouts from the more than 6,000 entries into this year's NPR Tiny Desk Contest. And today, it's Bandits On The Run. In their video submission, the trio performs on a completely empty New York City subway platform. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") BANDITS ON THE RUN: (Singing) I - I spent my ticket to ride going nowhere on a train past midnight. Bright city lights flicker in my eye... MCCAMMON: Bandits on The Run is Sydney Shepherd on cello, Regina Strayhorn on melodica and Adrian Enscoe playing guitar. And they join us now from, no surprise, our New York bureau. Welcome to the program. SYDNEY SHEPHERD: Hello. ADRIAN ENSCOE: Thanks for having us. REGINA STRAYHORN: Thanks. MCCAMMON: And I should note, you all have aliases, right? Adrian, you go by Roy Dodger, I'm told. ENSCOE: That's right. MCCAMMON: Regina, you're known as Clarissa. STRAYHORN: Mmm hmm. MCCAMMON: And, Sydney, Bonanza Jellyfish - what's that? SHEPHERD: That is correct (laughter). MCCAMMON: Should I even ask why? SHEPHERD: Well, we all sort of based our banded aliases on things in literature or pop culture that inspired us. And one of my favorite books is \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" by Tom Robbins. And there's a character named Bonanza Jellybean in there. So it's kind of a homage to that. MCCAMMON: OK, so onto the music. Your submission to NPR's Tiny Desk Contest is called \"Love In The Underground.\" And as I understand it, there is indeed a love story here. Is that right? ENSCOE: (Laughter). SHEPHERD: Yes. ENSCOE: Yeah, that's right. Me and Sydney actually met on a subway platform in New York City about five years ago. And I had been busking around town frequently. And Sydney had come down late at night on a platform where there were also very few people. And we just - she was listening to me. And we just started chatting about playing music and art and that kind of things. And one thing led to the next. And we ended up having a long conversation that extended deep into the night. And we knew that we were musicians. We started kind of collaborating a little bit. Sydney and Regina had had written a lot of songs together when they went to school before. SHEPHERD: Regina and I went to college together, so we go way back. ENSCOE: (Laughter). MCCAMMON: So Sydney and Adrian, you sort of start dating and the band sort of forms from that. (LAUGHTER) ENSCOE: So we learned, I think, three songs. And then I was like let's go down into the subway. And we just started playing these songs in the subway. STRAYHORN: And we played those three songs over and over again because the audience left every 15 minutes. So it worked out. MCCAMMON: I want to talk about - more about your music in a second. But real quick, Regina, I got to ask. What's it like being, you know, the third member of the band when the other two members are a couple? STRAYHORN: Oh, my. Well, you know what? It is good. It's all - you know, obviously a lot of fire. And I think that fire makes good music. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") BANDITS ON THE RUN: (Singing) But we're not strangers now. Finally found love in the underground. MCCAMMON: Well, you three have some pretty intricate, complex harmonies. You know, how do you - what's your process like? How do you develop those sounds? SHEPHERD: We all actually didn't go to music school. We went to acting school. So I feel like a lot of the sort of music that we end up creating is very intuitive. So a lot of the harmonies, like, sometimes we don't even know what note we're singing, but we know that it feels right. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") BANDITS ON THE RUN: (Vocalizing). SHEPHERD: And then it's a lot of repetition. And it's a lot of experimentation with that. And we know each other's voices so well by now that it's actually a very fast process, which is interesting. Like, sometimes we're writing the harmonies as we're writing the music. Like, it's sort of baked in to the fabric of the songwriting. It's not really just something that comes afterwards as an arrangement. And we don't really have like a set - like, you always do bottom, you always you middle, you always do top. Like, our things very much weave in and out of each other. And I think that's what keeps the sound interesting. I don't know. It's an interesting alchemy with the three of us. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") BANDITS ON THE RUN: (Singing) What a strange and sudden sound. But we're not strangers now. Finally found love in the underground. MCCAMMON: The New York City subway is such a part of your story, it sounds like, you know, from your origin story even to how you put your music together. So it's fitting, I guess, that the song that you submitted \"Love In The Underground\" is filmed underground in a New York City subway station. So it's really fun to watch, I have to say. But I kept watching it and thinking how did you pull that off, how did you manage to find an empty train station in New York. (LAUGHTER) STRAYHORN: Well, it was late at night, first off. But it was funny. We set everything up. And there - one of the MTA workers came up and was very disgruntled and was like, you need a permit. You need a permit for this and do you have a permit? And we just went no (laughter). SHEPHERD: But we were so - we were so not subtle about it, either. Like, our sound engineer brought down, like, all these microphones and, like, we were kind of, like, taking up a lot of space. So we couldn't really play dumb too much because we were just like, oh, yeah, we're definitely shooting a video down here. STRAYHORN: Yeah. SHEPHERD: It's, like, very obvious. STRAYHORN: And so the - and the MTA worker left. But then 30 minutes later, the cops came. But it was actually a very New York moment because it turns out that I knew them. I'd served them coffee at a coffee shop close by, like, a million times and given them a bunch of free coffee. And so they were like, hey, sorry, it's all about money, but you can't do this. And we're like it's OK. We already got the takes. So have a great night. Thank you. SHEPHERD: (Laughter) So then... MCCAMMON: So that 30 minutes was enough. STRAYHORN: Yes. ENSCOE: Oh, yeah. SHEPHERD: (Laughter). ENSCOE: Every single take, though, we were wondering... SHEPHERD: We were a little nervous. ENSCOE: ...Are we going to get arrested for this? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: The next L train is now arriving on the Manhattan-bound track. MCCAMMON: That's Sydney Shepherd, Adrian Enscoe and Regina Strayhorn of Bandits On The Run - one of our standout entries from this year's Tiny Desk Contest. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. ENSCOE: Thanks for having us, Sarah. STRAYHORN: Thank you. SHEPHERD: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOVE IN THE UNDERGROUND\") BANDITS ON THE RUN: (Singing) In the city of a million doors, open one, there's a million more, so what is it that you're waiting for, waiting for (ph)...

        "texts": "Bob Boilen Lucy Dacus is conflicted about America. The chorus of her new song, \"Forever Half Mast,\" begins with the line, \"Yes you're evil, but you're not that bad.\" The inspired songwriter from Richmond dropped me a note to say, \"I wrote it years ago as an answer to my own question about whether or not any American can be a good person since we are all passively benefitting from one of the most violent and destructive systems in the world. I don't so much believe in the dualistic idea of people either being good or bad anymore, but I still believe the sentiment.\" This song is part of a series of holiday-centric tunes Lucy Dacus has recorded. The first tune, released for Valentine's Day, was \"La Vie en rose,\" made famous by \u00c9dith Piaf. Lucy followed it with \"My Mother & I\" a song for Mother's Day. She says they're a way to understand the holidays. I find Lucy Dacus' words thought-provoking. As we approach the Fourth of July, I'm enamored by the next line in the chorus when she sings, \"you put out your palm more than the back of your hand.\" Lucy explains that \"what I mean is that the best you can do is stay aware of the hurt that America does and offer up generosity, empathy, and resistance in the face of it. The last lines of the song are, 'Wait for something magical, mistake turned into miracle,' which sums up the root of the song \u2014 how disorienting, and essential hopefulness is when surrounded by horror.\" That sense of hope is at the center of much of what Lucy Dacus writes about. It's a sentiment I feel we all need as we celebrate our coming day of Independence. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "captions": [],
        "texts": "LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In the Congolese village where Ephraim Bugumba was born, history, sacred myths and family law told through music is an honored tradition, so it makes perfect sense he also goes by the name StoryTeller. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"VOICES IN MY HEAD\") EPHRAIM BUGUMBA: (Singing) Hang your coat. Keep it color-coded. Fill my cup. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Twenty-three-year-old Bugumba is a refugee who survived the 1999 massacre at Makobola, in which 600 people died. He was only 3 years old when it happened, but psychological scars from the effect on him and his family remain. He sings about how it's affected his ability to display emotion in this song, \"Voices In My Head,\" which he submitted to NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest. Ephraim Bugumba now lives in DeKalb, Ill., and he joins us now from the studios of member station WNIU. Welcome to the program. BUGUMBA: Hey, Lulu. Thanks so much for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Oh, it's our pleasure. So I want to start with what happened to your family. How did you get out of the Congo? And where did you go? BUGUMBA: Well, it all started in the year 1999, when the massacre took place in my village, like you say, that - I was about 3 years old. And my father and my older brothers fled. And they went into the wilderness. And I was disguised as a little girl because the rebels would either kill the boys or turn them into child soldiers, so my mom got creative and dressed me up as a little girl in a little skirt. We walked, we hitchhiked some fleet trucks until we got to the refugee camp in Tanzania. And then from there, we stayed a few months, then moved to the refugee camp in Malawi and then from there moved to the refugee camp in Mozambique. We got splitted (ph) with my father. And then he went to Johannesburg, South Africa, for a little while. And then after that, we joined him over there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how did you get to America? And how old were you? BUGUMBA: I got to America in the year 2012 at 16 years old. We filed our case to the UNHCR, you know, which is a department that takes care of refugees. Now, where - my father is from a royal lineage, so his head had a price on it in per se, so my family was at risk of being murdered if we tried to go back home. And so we pleaded our case with the United States, and the UNHCR sponsored us to move here. And that's how we got here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did you experience coming to America? I mean, what was that transition like? BUGUMBA: It was definitely a dream come true to finally be able to live life without looking over your shoulder, without being afraid that someone was going to try to kill you, someone is going to try to take one of your family members from you. You know, it was definitely a relief. And it was, like I said, a dream come true. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did you end up using music to get you through your journey? BUGUMBA: My mother and father were musicians themselves. They met in the church choir. My father was my mother's choir master. Music has always been - it had always been a part of our life. You know, we gathered at 8 p.m. every night, and we sang. We read hymns. And my mom told us some stories from the Bible. This is how we got through the regular days. And then when we were fleeing in the forest in the wilderness, in all of that madness, my parents would always still gather us. And we would still pray, and we would sing. So it became our safety place, you know? In a world where everything was just uncertain; you were not sure if your next meal was going to come around. You were not sure if you were going to make it to the next meal. Music was the one thing that was sacred and safe. I knew that 8 p.m. was going to come along, and we were going to have a good time. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's listen to a little bit more of your song \"Voices In My Head.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"VOICES IN MY HEAD\") BUGUMBA: (Singing) And I'm not calling out for help. I'm just scared of being vulnerable. Said I got voices in my head. And they keep me up at night. And I'm not calling out for help. I'm just scared of being vulnerable, trying to stay alive. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you want to say with your music? What do you want people who listen to understand? BUGUMBA: I want to give hope. I want to remind people that no matter how dark it gets, it can always get better. I want to tell people that it's OK to talk about not being OK. I want to allow people to express themselves. I want to allow vulnerability even amongst men. You know, we have a great fear of being perceived as weak when we cry or when we laugh too loud or when we show compassion. I just want to let us all know that it's OK; that we're created for a reason. We have those things so we could get through life with them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Ephraim Bugumba, also known as StoryTeller - his Tiny Desk Contest entry \"Voices In My Head\" is on our website at npr.org. Thanks very much for speaking with us. BUGUMBA: Thank you so much for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"VOICES IN MY HEAD\") BUGUMBA: (Singing) Fill my cup. Fill it to the brim. I heard your voices screaming from the mountaintops.

Josh Brasted/Getty Images hide caption \"If you want to make a diaspora of things, you need to reach to a diaspora of people,\" GoldLink says. On this episode of All Songs Considered we've got a conversation with GoldLink about his latest album, Diaspora. (Hear the full interview with the play button at the top of the page). GoldLink has never been satisfied with just one sound. Since his breakout mixtape, 2013's The God Complex, the DMV rapper \u2014 that's Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia \u2014 created a dedicated online community during his mixtapes days by weaving together go-go, house, R&B and boom-bap. His fearless and wily disregard for genre rules caught the attention of producers like Rick Rubin and Kaytranada, and his 2016 single \"Crew,\" featuring DMV contemporaries Shy Glizzy and Brent Faiyaz, earned 'Link a Grammy nomination for Best Rap/Sung Performance \u2014 not to mention becoming an unofficial anthem for his hometown. Now, GoldLink goes global. Diaspora, his debut album on RCA Records, blends together Afrobeat, juju, bossa nova, reggae and so much more. It's all to create what GoldLink calls the decentralized future of music. Diaspora Courtesy of the artist hide caption The 26-year-old pulled collaborators from different diaspora \u2014 from Congolese artist Antonio \"Zapaterro StrongMan\" Nvuala on \"Zulu Screams\" to Hong Kong rapper Jackson Wang on \"Rumble\" \u2014 to give Diaspora its border-jumping feel. But he still made sure to give DMV-hailing staples Lil Nei, Bibi Bourelly and Pusha T time to shine. \"If you want to make a diaspora of things, you need to reach to a diaspora of people,\" he says. GoldLink joined All Songs Considered from the BBC in London to discuss the new music, rapid gentrification in D.C. and what he's learned about the universal black experience. \"Black people in Amsterdam or aboriginal people from Australia or black people from D.C., we don't know that we all have the same upbringing,\" he says. \"That maybe all our aunts have plastic on their couches or maybe we all have that grandma in the neighborhood. That actually happens everywhere.\" Tom Huizenga produced this episode for air. The biggest stories and ideas \u2014 from politics to pop culture \u2014 in 10 minutes.

        "texts": "Lars Gotrich This week, contemplate the existential chasm of life with Mizmor. Courtesy of Mariusz Lewandowski hide caption This week, contemplate the existential chasm of life with Mizmor. I always had WUOG on the radio back in the day \u2014 not just as a fan, but as one of the college station's music directors \u2014 to make sure there was a good variety of music in rotation. But when a DJ had to pee or take a smoke break, I knew: They'd play a long song \u2014 more specifically, Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Not that there's anything wrong with GY!BE, just that there's more to drawn-out music than apocalyptic post-rock. A long song is a great way to get lost, to engage with music that invites both wandering and deep listening. That's what this week's playlist on Spotify and Apple Music is all about. Alice Coltrane's raga-tinged Wurlitzer and her band's Afro Cuban polyrhythms make \"Los Caballos\" ecstatic music to cleanse your soul. Rafael Anton Irisarri smears the future-past in waves of distorted melody on \"Solastalgia (Suite One).\" Fela Kuti's \"Zombie\" blasts Afrobeat and the Nigerian military in a multi-front funk attack. There are so many ways to stretch out a sick riff or a wild groove. In an era where streaming now affects the lengths of songs, my weekly Bandcamp dig unearths some extended jams across metal, spoken-word drone and disco-infected psych-rock. (Note: Some of these tracks can only be found on Bandcamp.) Mizmor's sole member A.L.N. makes a habit out of side-long, blackened doom-metal dirges that grasp despair with riffs both blazing and lumbering. The opening track from Cairn introduces that sound with an acoustic melody that persists and ponders throughout its sulfurous rage. The French poet and composer's new album is one of the most engrossing ambient experiences of the year so far, a dense sound-world that moves at a timeless pace. The Flower and the Vessel closes with an 18-minute piece centered around a warm Fender Rhodes warped by whirring drone, not to mention Sunn O))) guitarist Stephen O'Malley adding a bit of feedback doom to F\u00e9licia Atkinson's soft spoken word. \"Pink Lady Lemonade\" is Acid Mothers Temple's \"Dark Star,\" so to speak, an enduring melody that's open to some very inter-planetary improvisation. I've seen the Japanese psych-rock band play several different versions of the song numerous times, but never with a disco groove locked into its hypnotic grip. David Garland lives in the long \u2014 last year's stunning Verdancy was four hours of folkloric avant-chamber music! Vulneraries pares down those exploratory practices in a duo setting with his son Kenji, who connected David's electronics-enhanced 12-string guitar with a modular synth. The result buzzes with pastoral possibility, as if finger-style guitarist Robbie Basho took to some cosmic knob twiddling. From Here to Eternity suggests an infinite sadness \u2014 a Smashing Pumpkins reference not lost on ambient composer Kyle Bobby Dunn \u2014 but more importantly, an understanding that the existential present moves forward. There are cracks of light in this elegantly bleak sculpture of sound, just enough to peek at what's ahead. It's right there in the Australian label's name and mission statement: Longform Editions seeks \"expansive and immersive music pieces from around the world.\" This 40-minute leap into the deep blue void is my introduction to Kasja Lindren, who breaks up whirlpools of drone with moaning cello, vinyl crackle and howling sax.

So the request of an upright piano was the last thing I expected when singer Katie Alice Greer and guitarist G.L. Jaguar talked about doing a Tiny Desk Concert. But we wheeled the Yamaha upright in place and they invited their accompanist Mary Voutsas to join bandmates Daniele Yandel and Alexandra Tyson. What we have is a kinder, gentler and starker version of this great band. Priests played only songs from their personally groundbreaking, genre-stretching album The Seduction of Kansas, an album produced with the creative force of John Congleton. The lyrics for the album's title track are a gateway into their philosophy \u2014 how the personal is political. Katie sings, \"It's the last picture show, all the cowboys, they get ready / For a drawn-out, charismatic parody / Of what a country thought it used to be.\" I'm glad we waited a bit into this band's life to bring them to the Tiny Desk; they're at a creative peak and they brought it home.

Sophia Schrank/Courtesy of the artist hide caption Bandits on the Run, composed of members Adrian Enscoe, Sydney Shepherd and Regina Strayhorn, submitted a stand-out video to the 2019 Tiny Desk Contest. Quinn Christopherson was named winner of 2019's Tiny Desk Contest and although the contest only has one winner, there were many impressive and touching performances submitted for the judges' consideration by the 6,000-plus contestants. This summer, Weekend Edition is highlighting some of the stand-out entries. Among those entrants is the New York-based trio Bandits on the Run, who submitted the original song \"Love in the Underground\" to the Contest. The group consists of Sydney Shepherd on cello, Regina Strayhorn on melodica and Adrian Enscoe on guitar. That said, the three members often go by their literature-inspired aliases: Roy Dodger for Enscoe, Clarissa for Strayhorn and Bonanza Jellyfish for Shepherd. Much of Bandits on the Run's work centers around the New York City subway system. The group often plays for in-transit crowds as they wait for their trains. In keeping with that practice, in their video submission, Shepherd, Strayhorn and Enscoe perform \"Love in the Underground\" on a completely empty subway platform. The video's credits specify that the song was performed \"without permission from the MTA\" \u2014 after fending off a disgruntled MTA officers for 30 minutes, the crew was asked by police to leave the scene, since they didn't have a permit to film there. Luckily, by the time the officers arrived, the Bandits had already finished the shoot. Even the band's origin story is tied up with the New York subway. Shepherd and Enscoe, who are in a romantic relationship, met on a platform where Enscoe was busking about five years ago. \"She was listening to me, and we just started chatting about playing music and art and that kind of thing,\" Enscoe recalls of that evening. \"And one thing led to the next, and we ended up having a long conversation that extended deep into the night.\" Bandits on the Run assembled when Strayhorn, a college friend and musical collaborator of Shepherd's, moved to New York. Shepherd had told Enscoe all about her friend and the music they had written together in college, and Enscoe was eager to carry on that work as a trio. \"So once Regina ended up moving to New York City, Adrian was like, 'OK, we're starting a band now!'\" Shepherd says. As for being the non-coupled member of this three-person band? Strayhorn says she doesn't mind. \"It's obviously a lot of fire, and I think that fire makes good music.\" Listen to the full aired conversation at the audio link.

April 15, 2019 \u2022 It's hard to imagine a more boring (and dreaded) word than \"mortgage.\" But if you know where to look, you might find a mortgage that will save you thousands of dollars a year or discover that you qualify for a loan when you didn't think you could \u2014 and that's exciting! You might even find free money to help with a down payment. Here's what to remember:\u2014 Shop around at all kinds of lenders \u2014 especially if you're a first-time homebuyer. \u2014 Find out if you qualify for a grant to help with a down payment.\u2014 Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start looking at houses.\u2014 If you can afford it, get a 15-year mortgage. You will build wealth much more quickly than with a 30-year mortgage.\u2014 Remember that adjustable-rate loans are risky.\u2014 Shop around to see if you can avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, or PMI.\u2014 Don't let the dreaded HELOC monster \u2014 home equity line of credit \u2014 eat your home equity.

We lay out a step-by-step approach to help you avoid those pitfalls, from what to look for in a house that will truly make you happy to assembling a team to help close the deal.Here's what to remember:- Find a good buyer's agent.- Make a list of what you need in a house and another of what you want.- Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start seriously house-hunting. - Plan on a monthly mortgage payment that is no more than a third of your take-home pay \u2014 and don't just listen to what the bank says you can afford. - Make an offer for what the house is actually worth. - Remember: There will always be another house. Choosing between renting or buying a home? Shannon Wright for NPR hide caption April 15, 2019 \u2022 Homeownership is something that most Americans say they aspire to one day. But how do you know if you're ready? In this episode, we look at the pros and cons of renting versus owning.Here's what to remember:- Owning a home is the No. 1 way most Americans build wealth.- Buying a house, however, is not an automatic ticket to the good life, and may not make you happier.- Renting gives you flexibility.- But that flexibility comes with a cost: Rents will always go up.- You don't need a big down payment to own a home.- Owning a home can give you a sense of security \u2014 and that can be priceless. April 12, 2019 \u2022 Buying a home is a huge undertaking. This Life Kit guide is here to help you figure out if you're ready to make that leap, and if you are, how to find the place of your dreams without breaking the bank.

        "texts": "Guy Raz dives into the stories behind some of the world's best known companies. How I Built This weaves a narrative journey about innovators, entrepreneurs and idealists\u2014and the movements they built. July 15, 2019 \u2022 In the early 1990s, Susan Griffin-Black was working for Esprit in San Francisco. On a business trip to London, she walked into a Covent Garden apothecary shop, picked up a bottle of lavender oil and took a whiff. The aroma \u2014 \"like being in a beautiful garden\" \u2014 literally changed her life. That was the inspiration to develop her own line of essential oil products. For 15 years, she and her husband and co-founder Brad Black barely scraped by, but the business eventually thrived. And though their marriage ultimately ended, their partnership continues. PLUS for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" Lia Heifetz of Barnacle Foods describes how she and her partners turned Alaskan bull kelp into pickles and salsa. July 8, 2019 \u2022 In 1989, college senior Wendy Kopp was trying to figure out how to improve public education in the US. For her senior thesis, she proposed creating a national teaching corps that would recruit recent college grads to teach in needy schools. One year later, she launched the nonprofit, Teach for America. Today, TFA has close to 60,000 alumni and continues to place thousands of teachers across the country. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" we check back with 19-year-old CEO Abby Kircher who turned a peanut butter obsession into Abby's Better Nut Butter. July 1, 2019 \u2022 Dave Dahl's entrepreneurial journey began in prison. In 1987, he was addicted to drugs and incarcerated for home burglary. For 15 years he bounced from one sentence to the next. But in the mid-2000s, Dave returned to his family bakery where he was inspired to make bread \u2013 organic, nutty, and slightly sweet. He sold the loaves at farmers markets and shared his story of recovery on the package \u2013 a branding decision that attracted fans and media attention. In 2015, the Dahl family sold the business for $275 million dollars. Today, Dave's Killer Bread sells over a dozen types of bread in grocery stores nationwide. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" armpit entrepreneurs Jason and Erica Feucht tell us how they turned whiskey and vodka into the natural deodorant Pit Liquor. June 24, 2019 \u2022 In 2004, two former Paypal engineers, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russ Simmons, were spit-balling new internet ideas. Out of their brainstorm came a site where you would email your friends asking for local business recommendations. The launch was a flop, but they discovered that people seemed to enjoy writing reviews not just for friends, but for the general public. Fifteen years later, Yelp is a publicly traded company with more than 4,000 employees and over 140 million monthly visitors. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" Liz Bales explains how putting cat food inside plastic mice became her full-time business and why it could revolutionize the way humans feed their cats. June 17, 2019 \u2022 Twenty-five years ago, after Mei Xu emigrated from China to the U.S., she loved going to Bloomingdale's to gaze at their housewares. She eventually started making candles in her basement with Campbell's Soup cans, an experiment that led to the multi-million dollar company Chesapeake Bay Candle. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" we check back with Dan Kurzrock and Jordan Schwartz, who turned up-cycled beer grain into a snack bar called ReGrained. June 10, 2019 \u2022 Growing up, Tim Brown discovered he was very good at two things: design and soccer. While playing professional soccer in New Zealand, he was turned off by the flashy logos on most athletic gear. He started making simple canvas shoes for his teammates, but soon discovered a better material: soft merino wool from his country's plentiful sheep. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, his future business partner Joey Zwillinger was frustrated that most companies lacked a genuine commitment to sustainability. In 2015, Tim and Joey teamed up to create Allbirds, a company with two ambitious goals: create the world's most comfortable shoes, and do it in a way that was completely carbon-neutral. Today, just three years after launch, Allbirds is worth $1.4 billion. PLUS, for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Kirby Erdely saw a problem with flying beach umbrellas and developed a new kind of tent stake\u2014with a twist. June 3, 2019 \u2022 Seth Tibbott may be the only founder in the world who grew his business while living in a barn, a teepee, and a treehouse. His off-the-grid lifestyle helped him save money as he started to sell tempeh, a protein made of fermented soybeans. Throughout the 1980s he barely scraped by, but things took a turn in 1995, when he discovered a stuffed tofu roast made in Portland, Oregon. Knowing vegetarians had few options at Thanksgiving, Seth named the roast Tofurky and started selling it at co-ops in the Pacific Northwest. Nearly 25 years later, Tofurky sells plant-based protein around the world, and has estimated sales of $40 million a year. Recorded live in Portland, Oregon. May 27, 2019 \u2022 In the 1990's, Stacy Madison and her boyfriend Mark Andrus were selling pita sandwiches from a converted hot dog cart in Boston. They decided to bake the leftover pita into chips, adding a dash of parmesan or cinnamon-sugar. At first they handed them out for free, but soon discovered that people were happy to pay for them. So they eventually decided to leave the sandwich cart behind and launch Stacy's Pita Chips. They hoped the brand might grow into a modest regional business\u2014but it kept growing. Roughly ten years after the launch, Stacy's sold to PepsiCo for $250 million. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Prerak Juthani and some friends from college took organic chemistry to the next level with REACT!, a board game that aims to demystify the stigma of molecular science. May 20, 2019 \u2022 Computer scientist Tony Hsieh made millions off the dot-com boom. But he didn't make his mark until he built Zappos \u2014 a customer service company that \"happens to sell shoes.\" Now Zappos is worth over a billion dollars and known for its completely unorthodox management style.

(Original broadcast date: January 23, 2017). May 13, 2019 \u2022 Chet Pipkin was the kind of kid who loved to take things apart and put them back together. As a young man in the early 1980s, he started hanging out in mom-and-pop computer shops, where he realized he could meet a growing need by selling the cables that connect computers to printers. That simple idea became the main ingredient in Chet's secret sauce: instead of making his own computers, he would make the accessories needed to make them work. Belkin International eventually grew into a massive manufacturer of electronic goods \u2014 last year, it sold to a subsidiary of Foxconn for more than $800 million. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Clay McCabe decided to rebrand his dad's zipper repair business into Zipper Rescue, a repair kit that helps people fix their broken zippers at home.

WHRV's 'Take My Word For It' from local author and communications expert, Danny Rubin, aims to give professionals practical career advice to help write, speak, and lead with confidence...and he'll provide these tips in sixty seconds! Whether you desire to write a more effective resume, chair a more productive meeting or craft an email that is more likely to be read, 'Take My Word For It' can help! July 11, 2019 \u2022 Do you have a big meeting on the horizon in which you'll be in charge? Here's a critical piece of advice: set the agenda ahead of time. Don't walk in the room ready to wing it. Map out the discussion, put the agenda items on paper and think through how you plan to budget the time. For instance, consider lighter topics at the beginning so you make more time for weightier issues and broader discussion. Bottom line: have a plan. Run an efficient meeting. And let everyone go back to their desks. Office meeting hero. July 5, 2019 \u2022 Today, let's mark the official retirement of a worn-out expression we hear too often in business. \"I don't disagree.\" What is so hard about saying the opposite \u2013 \"I agree.\" It's OK to let others be right. In fact, when you validate someone's opinion, the approach allows the person to feel important. And, in turn, it makes the person respect you more. When you say, \"I agree,\" everyone wins. \"I don't disagree\"? Welcome to retirement. Your work here is done. July 1, 2019 \u2022 Do you have a big job interview on the horizon? Before you step into the room, there's one page on the company's website you need to review. Why? 99% of job seekers will never check the page, and the extra effort might land you the job. The page? Press releases. Read about the company's latest achievements. Be prepared to talk comfortably about what you learned. The employer will be impressed you took the time to care about the company \u2013 and didn't just make the interview about you. Press releases. Find the page and watch what happens. June 21, 2019 \u2022 Are you a freelancer or looking for your next big gig? Here's a crucial tip for email outreach that will boost your response rate. In your email, make sure you prove you've done homework on the company where you want to freelance. That means visit the company's website and, in your email, highlight a blog post or piece of news that stands out to you. Make your email 100% customized. Take an interest in the employer first. That way, the employer will be more likely to take an interest in you. June 14, 2019 \u2022 Ever seen this move on Facebook? Someone will post an update like, \"So sorry to leave my job, but can't wait for my amazing new opportunity \u2013 exclamation mark prayer hands emoji.\" Then every single person who reads the update has the same question: \"Well, what's the new job?\" When you share big life moments on social media or through email, remember to actually share the life moment. Tell people about the new opportunity \u2013 your job title and the role you will play. Never leave your people in the dark. June 10, 2019 \u2022 Raise your hand if you have a boss who is too blunt over email. Actually...if you're driving...please, keep your hand on the wheel. Busy people are often too short in their emails, and the tone can feel cold or distant. Instead, imagine you spoke to the person face to face. Would you only give a one-word response, or would you make the conversation feel more natural? Take a few extra seconds and turn your message into a human exchange. The person on the receiving end will appreciate it. May 24, 2019 \u2022 Danny Rubin, author and communications expert, talks about exclamation marks in emails. May 23, 2019 \u2022 Danny Rubin, author and communications expert, explains why seasons are not capitalized. May 20, 2019 \u2022 Here's a professional tip: no one will ever complain you gave them less to read. Every time you write an email or document, ask yourself: Is this word necessary to make my point? What about the sentence? What about the entire paragraph? We all have short attention spans these days. Our goal as professionals is to bring the reader to the end of our message as soon as possible. Less. Is. More. I believe I've made my point. That means this radio segment is over. May 10, 2019 \u2022 Have you ever seen this grammar mistake on Facebook? A friend will write, \"Happy holidays from the Miller's!\" But the word \"Millers\" has an apostrophe before the \"s.\" That is incorrect. We use an apostrophe to show possession. As in, \"The Miller's cat got out again.\" \"Miller\" apostrophe \"s\" cat. Miller's cat. When the word in question is plural, add the \"s\" and that's it. Your grammar-loving friends on Facebook will appreciate you. New Home Buying NPR hide caption NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor",

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, his future business partner Joey Zwillinger was frustrated that most companies lacked a genuine commitment to sustainability.
